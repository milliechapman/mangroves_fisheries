149,9/15/16 0:00,Steppe to Tundra,"Johanna Mård Karlsson, Nicole Reid, Rodrigo Martínez-Peña","Garry Peterson, Juan Carlos Rocha","<p>Steppe (a grassland) to tundra (mosses and shrubs growing in waterlogged soils) is a regime shift that can occur in cold terrestrial ecosystems.&nbsp; Tundra and steppe regime shift is typically found where permafrost occurs.&nbsp; Steppe and tundra are primarily found in the Arctic, north of the tree line, where mean temperature below 10-12<sup>o</sup>C for the warmest month (Jonasson et al. 2000). Climate change and changes in the density of large herbivores are the main drivers of regime shifts between steppe and tundra. Climate changes that reduce soil moisture can favor steppe over tundra, and vice versa. Tundra is favored by moss growth, which is more limited by water than by nutrients. Steppe is favored by grass growth, which is improved by drier soils with available nutrients. Large herbivores can shape ecosystems through their impact on vegetation species composition, soil structure, and ecological dynamics. Large herbivore trampling and grazing can slow moss growth and convert tundra to steppe vegetation. At the end of the last ice age (12,000 yr BP), human hunting greatly reduced populations of large herbivores which may have contributed to a shift from grass-dominated steppe to moss-dominated tundra. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, climate change together with the presence of horses, bison, and musk oxen could lead to shifts between steppe and tundra vegetation.</p>","Harvest and resource consumption, Species introduction or removal, Global climate change",Extensive livestock production (rangelands),Tundra,"Primary production, Nutrient cycling",Biodiversity,"Freshwater, Livestock, Wild animal and plant products",Climate regulation,"Recreation, Aesthetic values, Knowledge and educational values, Spiritual and religious","Food and nutrition, Health (eg toxins, disease), Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values, Social conflict",,Sub-continental/regional,"Years, Decades",Hysteretic,"Models, Paleo-observation, Contemporary observations, Experiments",Well established – Wide agreement in the literature that the RS exists,"Contested – Multiple proposed mechanisms, reasonable evidence both for and against different mechanisms","Tundra to Boreal forest, Arctic Sea-Ice Loss, Greenland ice sheet collapse, Peatland transitions","<p><strong>Steppe</strong></p> <p>The steppe vegetation coverage is dominated by grasses growing in dry soils (Eroglu et al. 2012). In this regime, herbivores increase nutrient availability by accelerating nutrient cycling. This increases primary production. During the Pleistocene epoch, arctic steppes sustained large grazing herbivores such as mammoths, bison and yaks (Zimov 2005). Today, grasses still sustain reindeer/caribou population. Currently, the steppe communities of Yakutia, Siberia are confined to the terraces above floodplains and south facing slopes of the river valleys (Yurtzev 1982).</p> <p><strong>Tundra</strong></p> <p>The tundra vegetation coverage is dominated by mosses and shrub such as dwarf birches and willows growing in waterlogged soils. The ecosystem has lower primary production and nutrient cycling thus the growth rate is slow. Moss growth is limited by moisture so the moist and nutrient low soil promote and sustain moss growth.</p>","<p>Herbivory has caused large-scale vegetation changes across the Arctic (Speed et al. 2009; Br&aring;then et al. 2007; van der Wal 2005; Srivastava &amp; Jefferies 1996). Herbivores trample the vegetation and deposit faeces to nutrient limited soils which promotes grass growth sustaining herbivore population. In the absence of herbivores grass litter increases causing soil moisture to increase which reduces nutrient availability promoting the growth of unpalatable mosses.</p> <p>Climate can act as a driver by changing air temperatures which is associated with changes in soil moisture. Soil moisture is key component in sustaining moss or grass coverage. Moss growth is more limited by water than by nutrients. However, nutrients are more available in drier soils which promote grass growth. Currently, climate is changing, in the long term whether steppe, tundra or another regime will dominate Arctic ecosystems in uncertain.</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Steppe to Tundra</strong><br />Grass-dominated steppe is maintained by trampling and nutrient inputs from herbivore faeces. The enriched soils promote the growth of grass coverage (Shaver et al. 1986). Grasses have a strong influence on soil moisture as they dry out the soil through high transpiration (Zimov 2005). Dry soil conditions are associated with increased nutrient availability intensifying grass growth (Nadelhoffer et al. 1991).</p> <p>In the absence of herbivores, moss coverage increases creating water-logged soils (Zimov 1995). Water-logged soils prevent decomposition of organic matter, so nutrient availability decreases, which limits the growth of grasses and, hence, promotes moss growth instead (Zimov 1995). As moss growth increases, herbivore density is further reduced because moss have lower nutritional value.</p> <p>Moss-dominated tundra is susceptible to trampling, a disturbance caused by large herbivores; therefore, moss coverage increases with low herbivore density (van der Wal 2001). Mosses causes an increase in soil moisture. The combination of high soil moisture creates the conditions for water-logged soils establishing optimal conditions for moss growth (Zimov 1995).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Shift from Tundra to Steppe</strong></p> <p>Climate is the main driver that could shift tundra back to steppe; this is because large grazers don't exist any more and arctic ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change.&nbsp;Rising of air temperatures would deepen the thawing layer of permafrost and increase evaporation. Therefore, frozen nutrients from soil would become available, which would promote grass growth; in addition to that, higher temperatures will enhance organic matter decomposition and hence nutrient availability. Then, grasses will increase evaporation. Nevertheless, moist soil conditions might be resilient since permafrost melting will make frozen water available. If there are no draining conditions, moisture will provide a suitable environment for mosses that will insulate soil temperatures and then buffer permafrost melting.</p> <p><br />Rising of temperatures will create dynamics on arctic ecosystems that are difficult to predict. However, recent evidence shows that tundra could turn into different types of vegetation (e.g. shrub land, forest, lake, grassland) depending on local conditions (Karlsson et al. 2011). Steppe-grasses will prevail on drier areas, but more probably as patches within a mosaic since large herbivores that maintained steppe conditions during the Pleistocene, are not present.</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Steppe to tundra</strong></p> <p>Shifting from steppe to tundra had a great impact on provision of food. The&nbsp;thermal insulation of the tundra prevents permafrost melting, which prevents destabilization and collapse of infrastructure (Schaefer 2012).&nbsp;Increasing air temperature due to climate change deepens the active layer of permafrost. However, soils covered by moss, permafrost is less susceptible to degradation (Ivanova 2003), this ecosystem service is essential since permafrost contains almost twice as much carbon as the atmosphere today and its effects would be irreversible at human time scale (Schaefer et al. 2012).</p> <p>The&nbsp;wellbeing of nomadic indigenous peoples such as Nenets, Enets, Sami, Nganasans and Selkups, are connected to Arctic that provide opportunities for grazing and food sources, as well as ecosystems that co-produce cultural ecosystem services i.e. production and conservation of indigenous knowledge, practices and believes, as well as production of scientific knowledge (Huntington 2013). Tourism is also a cultural ecosystem service that will be affected.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Tundra to steppe</strong></p> <p>Arctic soils covered by mosses, permafrost is less susceptible to degradation (Ivanova 2003). Transition from tundra to steppe implies loss of this buffering layer. Consequence, the following ecosystem services will be impacted:&nbsp;Water availability. Local and regional freshwater dynamics will change leading to a decline in the number of lakes and wetlands (Wrona et al. 2016; Schaefer 2012).&nbsp;Increased abundance of grassland will affect livestock production, steppe might benefit both reindeer hunters and herders.&nbsp;Protection from infrastructure destabilization; pipelines, railways and power lines across the arctic are built on solid ground provided by the permafrost that if degraded their stability might be lost. This might cause economic costs and serious ecological damages (Schaefer, 2012).&nbsp;Fire regulation; as moss tundra shifts to a drier regime, possibilities of wild fires will increase, which contributes to thermal erosion of permafrost (Schaefer, 2012). Prevention of climate change; permafrost degradation turns permafrost's carbon stock into a carbon source, which would accelerate climate change (Schuur et al. 2015). Loss of this ecosystem service impacts the global level, since permafrost contains twice as much carbon as the atmosphere and effects of release is irreversible at human time scale (Schaefer, 2012).</p> <p>Cultural ecosystem services will also be affected; conservation of indigenous knowledge, practices and believes related to tundra would be lost, affecting the well being of t he Nenets, Enets, Sami, Nganasans and Selkups (Huntington 2013).</p>","<p>To prevent the steppe&nbsp;from shifting into tundra, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced in order to avoid the effects of climate change. The planetary boundary value for atmospheric CO2 concentration is 350 ppm above pre-industrial level (Rockstrom et al. 2009). This was further supported by the COP21 agreement, a treaty signed to limit temperature increase to 1.5<sup>o</sup>C compared to pre-industrial levels. These efforts are not enough to prevent the feedback loop, eliminating emission is the only solution. In the Artic, land management strategies can address feedback loop on the local level. In a study, by Post and Pederson (2008), a 5-year experimental investigation of Arctic plant community response to warming, showed that warming under continuous grazing pressure from muskoxen did not differ from plant composition without warming suggest that management of large herbivores may be an important aspect for mitigating ecosystem response to future climate change</p> <p>Attempts are being made today to restore the Pleistocene steppe ecosystem on a limited spatial extent in Siberia. Sergey Zimov's Pleistonce Park, 160 km<sup>2</sup>, attempts to reestablish the steppe ecosystem by reintroducing megafauna to Northern Siberia (Republic of Yakutia). Zimov (2005) and colleagues tried to test if the 'key-herbivore&acute; hypothesis can be verified, as today's Holocene climate should be optimal for the Pleistocene steppe vegetation. The megafauna consisting of reindeer, moose, Yakutian horses, musk oxen and bison would influence the vegetation and soil composition, by trampling on grassland and returning nutrients to the soil through their manure (Zimov 2005). The grass root systems stabilize the soil and trampling reduces the albedo, exposing ground to colder temperatures, both would prevent permafrost from melting.</p>","(#1) ACIA.

There is a natural fluctuation between these two ecosystems. However, the rate and scale at which those fluctuations are occurring are increasing due to permafrost melting caused by the increasing atmospheric temperatures associated with climate change. Warmer air temperature increases soil temperature, which melts permafrost (permanently frozen soils found in Arctic regions). The shift in ecosystems occurs when permafrost degradation becomes severe enough for the lakes to get permanently drained, creating the necessary conditions for vegetation to establish. The increased rate and scales of these land cover changes has extensive impacts on food and freshwater provisioning, but its greatest impact is on carbon sequestration. The melting of permafrost releases greenhouse gases, i.e. carbon dioxide (CO<sup>2</sup>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), which further increase climate change, creating a powerful reinforcing feedback.&nbsp;</span></p>",Global climate change,Fisheries,"Tundra, Rock and Ice","Soil formation, Nutrient cycling, Water cycling",Biodiversity,"Freshwater, Fisheries, Fuel and fiber crops, Hydropower","Climate regulation, Regulation of soil erosion, Natural hazard regulation",Aesthetic values,Security of housing & infrastructure,,"Local/landscape, Sub-continental/regional","Months, Years, Decades, Centuries",Irreversible (on 100 year time scale),"Models, Contemporary observations",Contested – Reasonable evidence both for and against the existence of RS,Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism,"Arctic Sea-Ice Loss, Thermohaline circulation","<p><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>Due to thermokarst processes such as permafrost melting, numerous areas of the Arctic landscape are extremely lake-rich.&nbsp; The water balance of those lakes may either be maintained due to impermeable permafrost that limits groundwater flow (Marsh 2009) or lost due to seasonal drainage, a natural characteristic of the Arctic system. However, a widespread, unnatural decline in lake abundance is being observed within the Arctic due to decades of rising atmospheric temperatures in the region that has been deteriorating the state of the permafrost (Smith et al. 2005). The lake-rich landscape of the Arctic is therefore slowly transforming into a drained, dry landscape increasingly dominated by vegetation such as shrubs and graminoids (Hinzman 2005).</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Thermokarst lake ecosystem</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>The thermokarst lake-dominated landscape is formed as a response to some imposed disturbance, such as road construction, wildfire or climatic warming, which causes permafrost to thaw, creating irregular surface topography depressions, called thermokarsts. Those may appear as near-surface massive ice melts, allowing the surface to subside (Hinzman et al. 2005). As permafrost melts over time, those depressions become filled with melted water forming the lakes characteristic of the Arctic region. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Terrestrial ecosystem</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>Driven by external and internal factors, Arctic lakes are drying up at an unnatural speed within the region. This shift is accompanied by changes in vegetation, for example, increased shrub- and graminord abundance and a decrease in the cover of mosses and lichens through a broad expanse of the Arctic (Hinzman et al. 2005). The changes in vegetation may then further transform the landscape through sequential effects on foraging mammals and birds, as well as aquatic fauna and insects (Hinzman et al 2005).</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Shift from thermokarst lakes to terrestrial ecosystem</strong></p> <p><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>The main external driver of this regime shift is climate change, which is caused by elevated greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC 2007). Increased temperatures warm the soil and warms the&nbsp;permafrost.

At a local scale, the effects of climate change are incremental. However, as this interaction is occurs&nbsp;over large areas, the effects are aggregated and self-reinforcing, which is significant since permafrost and seasonally frozen grounds store about 25%&nbsp;of the total global soil carbon stock (IPCC 2007).</span></p> <p><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>At a local scale, initial thawing of the permafrost from increased atmospheric temperatures creates a dynamic landscape of depressions (thermokarst) in which lakes are formed (IPCC 2007). As permafrost become more degraded, drainage through outlet channels occurs. Since the temperature of melted water is higher than that of ice, it will exacerbate the melting of permafrost, causing another reinforcing feedback. Once the layer of frozen ground is completely penetrated the lakes can become permanently drained allowing for vegetation to be established (Marsh et al. 2008).</span></p> <p><strong>Shift from terrestrial ecosystem to thermokarst lake ecosystem</strong></p> <p><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>Heightened air- and soil temperatures melt the ice-rich soils and permafrost on which forests in the Arctic region develop, changing the physical conditions for the forest growing on top of it. When the roots of the trees get flooded, the trees die and ponds and lakes eventually replace the forest (Hinzman 2005). However, it is important to note that the shift from a terrestrial ecosystem to a lake dominated one is not as frequent as the shift from lakes to terrestrial ecosystems. The reason for this are the reinforcing feedbacks as mentioned above.</span></p>","<p><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>The warming of soil temperatures leads to the melting of continuous permafrost and the subsequent increase in abundance of discontinuous or sporadic permafrost. Melting of permafrost causes depressions in the soil called thermokarsts. Increased precipitation in the form of snowfall may have either an insulating or cooling effect on soil temperatures depending on several variables such a timing, duration, accumulation, and melting processes of seasonal snow cover, density, structure, and thickness of seasonal snow cover etc. (Zhang 2005). Depending upon the local surface energy balance, the thawed ground may refreeze or the permafrost can continue to degrade (Hinzman et al. 2005).&nbsp;</span><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>On sites where continuous permafrost is thawing the active layer of soil in which melted water can move deepens allowing for the formation of thermokarst lakes (Hinzman et al. 2005). In freezing seasons, if the temperature is low enough and the hydraulic parameters on site suitable, the formation of these lakes can contribute to the re-formation of permafrost soils. Ice-rich permafrost can also prevent surface water from infiltrating to deeper groundwater zones, causing surface soils to be very wet. </span><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>Decreased albedo due to changes in vegetation, the extension of snow-free and ice-free periods on terrestrial and lake surfaces and abundance, and reduction in the area occupied by glaciers and continental ice sheets in high latitudes may act as a positive feedback into atmospheric warming (Hinzman et al. 2005).</span></p> <p><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>On sites where there is an abundance of discontinuous permafrost the active layer also deepens allowing for increased surface area for sub-ground water movement that increases the rate of drainage. Thermokarst lakes and ponds may begin to fill or drain depending upon the direction of the hydraulic gradient beneath the lake (Hinzman et al. 2005). Therefore it is not the depth of the active layer alone that determines the rate of drainage. However, increased drainage of lakes may prevent the reformation of permafrost from lack of available water for freezing in winter months and it can be inferred through advection of heat from decreased albedo. Once these drained lake beds become permanently drained they are likely to be re-vegetated which will change the albedo and may cause the extension of snow-free and ice-free periods and may act as feedback into increasing atmospheric temperature </span><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>(Hinzman et al. 2005). </span></p> <p><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>The affects of the shifts from lake to terrestrial ecosystems are aggregated at a local, regional and global scale due to the large scale and frequency at which those dynamics occur.

The above-ground stored freshwater, which is of vital importance to migratory birds, fish, and other wildlife used by indigenous people, will shift to below-ground stored freshwater (Artic Science Journeys Radio Stories 2005).&nbsp;Globally, however, freshwater will become a more abundant ES due to reductions permafrost and subsequently ice sheets and glaciers resulting from the regime&rsquo;s feedbacks to climate change. Nevertheless, this global increase in the freshwater ES is not a positive one: &ldquo;Increased freshwater delivery to the Arctic Ocean from reductions in ice sheets and glaciers result in rising sea level (...)&rdquo; (Hinzman et al. 2005).&nbsp;At a local scale traditional hunting and fishing practices will be impaired (Vincent et al. 2013).&nbsp; Arctic freshwater systems provide important migratory routes for fish stock. Due to this regime shit, those routes would be greatly altered in connectivity among lakes and river channels, as well as in terms of their physical coupling to the coastal marine ecosystem (Vincent et al. 2012). Globally, fishing practices would suffer as well. Increased discharge of water into the Arctic Ocean due to draining results in increased nutrient and external organic matter inputs to the Arctic Ocean that affect primary processes at the base of the marine food web (Vincent et al. 2012).&nbsp;Climate regulation is heavily affected on a global scale through the processes of this regime shift: as it sets up a positive feedback cycle in which the release of methane and carbon dioxide through the newly exposed soil and melted permafrost feeds into global warming.&nbsp;The shift from lakes to terrestrial ecosystems heightens gully erosion, a type of erosion that occurs when water is channeled across unprotected land and washes away the soil along the drainage lines.

Mateos","Garry Peterson, Juan Carlos Rocha","<p>This regime shift has been well studied in the interior Alaska where the coniferous dominated boreal forest are being replaced by deciduous trees due to recent climate warming and changes in the wildlife regime.&nbsp;Coniferous trees thrive in cold, moist soil conditions, and enhance these conditions by accumulating a deep soil organic layer. The moisture of the soil prevents frequent fires from occurring, but when they do, the soil organic layer is rarely consumed in its entirety due to the high water content. Deciduous trees, on the other hand, thrive in nutrient rich, dry and warm soils, which are conditions that they reinforce by keeping the decomposition rate high, making the soil organic layer shallow. Fires tend to be more frequent than in coniferous dominated forests, but not as intense. A severe fire can get the system to shift from one regime to the other, while changes in climate (i.e. mainly temperature or precipitation) can change the underlying conditions to make each regime less resilient.&nbsp;This regime shift may affect the provisioning of wild products such as berries and game. An increase in fire frequency may also decrease air quality. &nbsp;</p>","Environmental shocks (eg floods), Global climate change","Timber production, Conservation, Tourism",Temperate & boreal forests,"Soil formation, Primary production, Nutrient cycling, Water cycling",Biodiversity,"Freshwater, Wild animal and plant products, Timber, Woodfuel","Air quality regulation, Climate regulation, Water purification, Regulation of soil erosion","Recreation, Aesthetic values","Food and nutrition, Health (eg toxins, disease), Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values",,"Local/landscape, National (country)","Decades, Centuries","Irreversible (on 100 year time scale), Hysteretic","Models, Paleo-observation, Contemporary observations",Well established – Wide agreement in the literature that the RS exists,Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism,,"<p style=''margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.4pt; background: white;''><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>The boreal forest in northern Interior Alaska covers an approximate area of 48 million hectares (Mann et al. 2012). Bounded by the Alaska Range to the south, the Seward Peninsula to the west and Brooks Range to the north (Wolken et al. 2011). It is characterized by large areas of gently sloping uplands and flat lowlands isolated by mountain ranges and braided rivers with broad floodplains. During the past 50 years, the mean annual temperature in the interior boreal forest of Alaska has increased by 1.3 &ordm;C (Hartmann and Wendler, 2005) and this has been strongly associated with recent increase in fire frequency and severity (Wolken et al. 2011). The annual area burned in Interior Alaska has doubled during the last decade (Kasischke et al. 2010). The forest has been dominated by coniferous trees (mainly black spruce), which is a group of species that thrive under colder, moist conditions in a deep soil organic layer. However, due to climate warming, Interior Alaska is currently&nbsp;shifting towards a deciduous dominated forest (e.g. aspen and birch) that prefer warmer and drier conditions with a shallow soil organic layer (Johnstone et al. 2010). &nbsp;</span></p> <p style=''text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;''>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Low fire frequency coniferous dominated forest</strong></p> <p>Under cold and wet conditions, coniferous trees, such as the black spruce (<em>Picea mariana</em>), dominate the boreal forest in Interior Alaska. The coniferous trees promote the accumulation of a deep soil organic layer, cold and moist soil temperatures, and slow decomposition rates. Due to the moistness of the soil, fires are not frequent in these forests. However, when they occur, they tend to be severe due to the high flammability of the black spruce. Due to the high water content of the soil organic layer, it will only be entirely consumed by the most severe fires (Johnstone&nbsp;et al. 2010). As long as the entire organic layer has not been consumed, the coniferous trees have a regenerative advantage due to their seed&rsquo;s ability to sprout in moist organic soils. This means that these forests tend to return to a coniferous dominated state even after a fire (Hollingsworth&nbsp;et al.&nbsp;2013).</p> <p style=''text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;''>&nbsp;</p> <p style=''margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;''><strong><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>High fire frequency deciduous dominated forest</span></strong></p> <p style=''margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;''><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>A deciduous dominated forest, mainly consisting of aspen and birch trees in Interior Alaska, prefers and reinforces dry and warm soil conditions. Although these forests have a high organic litter production, the fast decomposition rate and the subsequent fast nutrient turnover, leaves a shallow soil organic layer and a nutrient rich mineral soil that favours deciduous tree regeneration. The warm and dry conditions in the forest lead to a comparatively high fire frequency, but due to the low flammability of the deciduous trees, the fires rarely become very severe (Johnstone et al.</span><span class=''apple-converted-space''><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>&nbsp;</span></span><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>2010). However, because of the shallow pre-fire soil organic layer, the fires tend to expose the mineral soil, which favours the post-fire reproduction of deciduous trees (Hollingsworth et al.</span><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>&nbsp;2013).</span></p> <p style=''text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;''>&nbsp;</p>","<p style=''margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.4pt; background: white;''><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>The main external direct driver of the regime shift is climate warming, which affects the important feedbacks of the boreal forest ecosystem. Warmer and drier climatic conditions have a direct effect on the most important soil characteristics (i.e. soil temperature, moisture and depth of the soil organic layer), influencing the vegetation cover. Coniferous trees require a cold moist soil with a deep soil organic layer to successfully reproduce. Deciduous trees, on the other hand, are competitively superior under warmer and drier soil conditions with a shallow soil organic layer (Johnstone et al. 2010). Extended summer seasons and the accompanying drier conditions create a suitable environment for an increase in the annual number of natural ignitions by lightning strikes (Kasischke et al. in press). Fires have an immediate effect on the environmental conditions of the forest, affecting factors such as soil moisture and the post-fire forest community composition (Kelly et al. 2012). Once established, the trees support and emphasize the conditions that favour their own reproduction and dominance. Under colder environmental conditions, coniferous trees, such as the black spruce, produce large amounts of organic litter, which, together with the presence of permafrost, maintains a moist soil and slow decomposition rates, contributing to a deep soil organic layer. Under warmer climatic conditions, deciduous trees produce ground layer fuels that decompose at fast rates, maintaining a shallow organic layer (Johnstone et al. 2010). Global socio-economic development indirectly drives climate warming, contributing to the increased atmospheric temperatures through e.g. greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 2011). Fire management can have a limited effect on the regime shift through fire suppression practices.</span></p>","<p style=''margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;''><strong style=''line-height: 24.023998260498047px; text-align: justify;''><span style=''font-size: 12pt; line-height: 24px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: windowtext;''>Shift from coniferous to deciduous-dominated forest</span></strong></p> <p style=''margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.4pt; background: white;''><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>The coniferous dominated boreal forest of Interior Alaska requires a deep soil organic layer to succeed over other classes of trees.

If the severity of such external shocks is sufficient, thresholds in the most important regime characteristics will be crossed (e.g. shallow post-shock soil organic layer) creating windows of opportunity for deciduous species to dominate. Atmospheric temperature influences the frequency and severity of fires, the soil characteristics and the length of the growing season; therefore, climate warming can also cause a change in conditions that would set the grounds for a shift to a new stable state (Mann et al. 2012).</span></p> <p style=''margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.4pt; background: white;''><span style=''font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;''>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=''margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.4pt; background: white;''><span style=''font-family: Arial;''>The deciduous dominated forest has a competitive advantage in warm and dry conditions with shallow soil organic layers.

A slow change of the environmental conditions towards those that favour a coniferous boreal forest could, if the forest is left undisturbed for a sufficiently long time, lead to late successional coniferous species, like the black spruce, replacing early successional deciduous species (Rupp et al. 2002). Although the spatial scale considered is of extreme importance, sufficiently large external shocks, such as deciduous-specific insect outbreaks, could clear sufficiently large areas to advance the dominance of coniferous trees. In such hypothetical events, coniferous trees could get the opportunity to sprout and start altering the soil conditions to their own favour.</span></p>","<p>The provisioning of wild products such as berries and game is expected to shift some species and decrease others, but it is unclear what the net changes will be (Chapin et al. 2008). The boreal forest is likely to become a net source of carbon to the atmosphere (McGuire et al. 2009; Schuur et al. 2009), while the air quality is expected to decrease periodically due to the increase in fire frequency (Chapin et al. 2008).</p>","<p>The primary tactic used for reducing impacts of fire and enhance resilience (i.e. maintain structures, feedbacks, functions and processes of regime 1 is fire suppression to reduce the fire severity (Chapin et al. 2008). Decrease in fire severity could prevent the fire from consuming the soil organic layer, which in turn favours the conditions for coniferous tree. Fire suppression should be maintained in Alaska since it minimizes the risk fire imposes to life and property in communities. However, distant fires should be allowed to burn under controlled conditions, since it could have a cooling effect at a regional scale due to the higher albedo of post-fire deciduous species compared to the previous coniferous forest (Chapin et al. 2008).</p> <p>Reducing air temperature is essential to be able to restore regime 1. Alaska itself accounts for a miniscule proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions and consequently to climate warming (Chapin et al. 2008). Therefore, reducing Alaska&rsquo;s emissions will not have a major impact on global climate change. Global abatement of emissions is the long-term solution. Regardless of global greenhouse gas emission policies, it is highly likely that recent warming and wildfire frequency will continue for several decades in Alaska due to the multidecadal lag in the climate system (IPCC, 2007). This makes the reduction of emissions an inefficient short-term solution.&nbsp; Secondary challenges that face efforts to achieve reduced emissions include restricting the economy and changing the focus of developed nations on a continued economic but sustainable growth. Educating global public about the social impacts of climate change in Alaska and other parts of the world (e.g. reduction in ecosystem services) may promote the willingness to reduce emissions (Chapin et al. 2008).</p> <p>In summary, this means that the regime shift from coniferous to deciduous dominated forest in theory could be reversible through manipulation of e.g. soil conditions or local climate. However, due to projected global socio-economic development and climate change, it is highly unlikely that reversing the regime shift will be possible during the next 100 years.</p>","(#1) Beck, Pieter S.A., Glenn P.

This regime shift involves a change from an ecosystem with high numbers of predatory fish to one dominated by pelagic planktivores. The shift is often initiated by high fishing pressure on top-predators followed by a trophic cascade, but can also be brought about by other environmental factors like global warming and upwelling increase. In extreme cases the food web is shortened due to disappearance of top predators and the carbon transfer pathways is dominated by microbial webs instead of the classic trophic chain. The new regime can be enforced and maintained by biological mechanisms including minimum population biomass, competition and dietary relations, or environmental conditions. Despite there being some mechanism that often dissipate the trophic cascade, food web regime shifts do have substantial impact on commercial fisheries, as well as increase the vulnerability of an ecosystem to eutrophication, hypoxia and invasion by non-native species.</p>","Harvest and resource consumption, External inputs (eg fertilizers), Global climate change",Fisheries,Marine & coastal,Primary production,Biodiversity,Fisheries,,"Recreation, Aesthetic values","Food and nutrition, Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values, Cultural identity",,"Local/landscape, National (country), Sub-continental/regional",Years,Hysteretic,"Models, Contemporary observations, Experiments","Speculative – Regime shift has been proposed, but little evidence as yet","Contested – Multiple proposed mechanisms, reasonable evidence both for and against different mechanisms","Fisheries collapse, Hypoxia, Forest to Savannas","<p>This regime shift involves an abrupt reorganization of an aquatic food web due to a decrease in top predators or increase in environmental factors like temperature. Trophic cascades play a central role in these regime shifts. During these cascades groups in adjacent trophic levels often show inverse patterns in their abundance (Carpenter 2003). In other words, every other trophic level displays an increase in biomass, which leads to increased predation pressure and biomass decrease on every other trophic level. Most trophic cascades are described in ecosystems with low species diversity and/or simple food webs and/or small size (Frank et al. 2005). The magnitude of a trophic cascade varies depending on species diversity, regional oceanography, local physical disturbance, habitat complexity and fishery practices (Salomon et al. 2010). Food webs with more trophic levels and biodiversity show less trophic cascades than simpler systems (Salomon et al. 2010); due in part to omnivory and the variation on trophic interaction strength (Bascompte et al. 2005). However some documented examples includes subtidal reefs in New Zealand (Shears and Babcock 2002), Caribbean coral reefs (Bellwood et al. 2004), the Gulf of Maine (Steneck et al. 2004), and the North Atlantic (Kirby et al. 2009).</p> <p><strong>Predator-dominated food web. </strong></p> <p>Ecosystems in this regime are characterized by high predatory fish, low planktivorous fish, high zooplankton and low phytoplankton abundance. Such ecosystems can be subject to human influence, such as intensive fishery, but exhibit so called &ldquo;natural compensation&rdquo; e.g. via species richness and omnivory (Pace et al. 1999) that maintain the regime. Despite high productivity, such ecosystems are less likely to suffer from eutrophication due to high grazing pressure on phytoplankton. Ecosystem services associated with predator-dominated food webs includes food provision, higher biodiversity, better disease and pest control, as well as cultural services like recreation and aesthetic values (e.g. diving, sport fishing).</p> <p><strong>Planktivore-dominated food web. </strong></p> <p>Ecosystems in this regime are characterized by low predatory fish, high planktivorous fish, low zooplankton and high phytoplankton abundance. In extreme cases the actual number of trophic levels (TLs) can decrease. Ecosystems with lower trophic level dominance are more vulnerable to eutrophication due to lowered grazing pressure on phytoplankton, as well as invasion of planktivore organisms like jellyfish. A planktivore-dominated food web can affect the fluxes of carbon, transforming aquatic systems -coastal and lakes- from sinks to sources of green house gases (Bakun et al. 2010; Estes et al. 2011). Other ecosystem services like fisheries and recreation are expected to be significantly reduced.</p>","<p>Trophic cascades are usually initiated by fishing pressure that have direct or indirect impacts on the abundance of top predators. The response time to these drivers varies across ecosystems. In the case of coastal areas it has been found that the ecosystem response time to overfishing can vary from decades to centuries where multiple predators exist (Jackson et al. 2001).</p> <p>Other factors that affect the regime shift are global warming and demand of food and fiber. Global warming have effects on upwelling, water circulatory systems that bring nutrients from the bottom of the sea towards the surface. By altering upwellings, food webs receive either too much or too little nutrients. In both cases the energy transferred towards higher trophic levels diminish as nutrients input variability increase. Demand of food strongly drives fishing, being the main cause of lost of top predators over the world.</p>","<p>Predator dominated food webs occur in environments with low disturbance both from fishing and nutrients input. They usually have four or more trophic levels. The regime is maintained by biotic mechanism that comprise predation and competition both intra and inter species. Abiotic factors also play a role maintaining the regime, by allowing an intermediate level of nutrient inputs from the deep ocean necessary for sustaining the food web.</p> <p>In general, a combination of low top predator productivity due to poor recruitment or somatic growth combined with high exploitation pressure are conditions under which regime shifts in aquatic food webs are likely to occur (Daskalov et al. 2007). Overfishing can unbalance trophic relations, changing the configuration of competition and predation. Weak competitors may become stronger given less fishing pressure on such stocks, or by favoring the reproduction of it&rsquo;s preys by fishing its competitor species. In addition, changes in nutrients inputs can represent an advantage for lower trophic levels, allowing them to escape the control of its predators.</p> <p>As result, the ecological function of certain species groups is changed, allowing over abundance of immediate lower level. For example, the decrease of top-predators allows over abundance of meso predators that in turn reduces planktivorous fish and increase zooplankton. Further increase in nutrients from upwellings can lock the food web in a state dominated by planktivore fish as jellyfish. Low nutrients input, on the other hand, would reduce the amount of energy available for the food web and as a result an abrupt reduction of higher trophic levels is expected.</p>","<p><strong>Shift from predators to planktivore dominated food webs</strong></p> <p>Commercial fish stocks that are locked into a regime where they are maintained at low levels of abundance has obvious economic consequences on fisheries industry. However, these fisheries related shifts are not always negative, as for example a decrease in top predators can increase the catches of mid-level prey (e.g. shrimps and clupeids) (Frank et al. 2005). When an ecosystem-wide regime shift occurs it affects not only targeted groups, such as commercial fish (Daskalov et al. 2007) but also impacts other ecosystem functions. Biodiversity as well as ecosystem resilience may be reduced by a shift from an ecosystem with high top predator diversity and dominance to a system with lower trophic level dominance. This means that ecosystem may become more vulnerable to both climatic and anthropogenic change. Such ecosystems may more easily suffer from eutrophication, hypoxia and invasion by non-native species. Eutrophication and hypoxia in turn lead to increased algal blooms and decrease the recreational values of water bodies.</p> <p>Predators and commercial fish stocks have remained under 10% of their previous sizes even after decades of fishing closure (Ainley and Blight 2009). Food production, primary productivity, pest regulation, and cultural services are the ecosystem services most affected by the reduction of food webs, which in turn increases the risk of fisheries collapse. Depletion of fish stocks has been estimated to have affected the employment of roughly 14 million fishermen, 12 million of which correspond to artisanal fisheries (Hassan et al. 2005). Fish catches are projected to further decrease in the 21st century affecting protein sources for people, especially in poor regions (Hassan et al. 2005). The estimated current contribution of fisheries to human protein consumption is 29 million tons produced industrially and 24 million tons in small-scale fisheries (Hassan et al. 2005).</p>","<p><strong>Options for enhancing resilience</strong></p> <p>In food webs that exhibit strong top-down control, decreasing the fishing pressure on top predators is an obvious strategy (Scheffer et al. 2001; Frank et al. 2005). However, due to the hysteresis effect, return to a predator-dominated food web may often require substantially lower fishing levels than that which induced the regime shift, together with additional measures. Hence, restoration is usually costly, especially to fisherman (Moellmann et al. 2009). As mentioned above, environmental factors can play an important role in maintaining alternative food web regimes. Nutrient loading is one of the key parameters controlling processes such as eutrophication and hypoxia. However, decreasing nutrient loads in marine environments requires large scale actions and often collaboration at international level (e.g. Helsinki Commission Baltic Sea Action Plan in the Baltic Sea). Hence, the time-frame of these actions in addition to time-lag in ecosystem response is often long. Climatic variation cannot be directly controlled by human actions. However, climate impacts can be mediated by employing other management measures that contribute to maintaining healthy marine ecosystems with high biodiversity and resilience, which then can compensate for changes in climate.</p> <p><strong>Options for reducing resilience to encourage restoration or transformation </strong></p> <p>In addition, in small closed food webs systems (3 to 4 trophic levels), biomanipulation has been suggested to manage one of the symptoms of degraded marine environments, namely eutrophication. This involves increasing the population of predatory fish such as bass, pike and walleye through stocking or reduced angling quotas. Increased populations of these predators leads to a decrease in the level of zooplanktivores. This in turn allows an increase in the population of planktivores that graze on the algae and zooplanckton, helping to reduce the algal density and phytoplankton respectively(Smith and Schindler 2009). This option, however, has limited reach when it comes to open marine foodwebs, where seasonal migrations and metapopulation dynamics are common.</p>","(#1) Ainley, D. G., and L. K. Blight. 2009.

137,10/14/14 0:00,Fisheries collapse,"Garry Peterson, Juan Carlos Rocha","Henrik Österblom, Reinette (Oonsie) Biggs","<p>A fishery collapses when the structure of the marine community (i.e. its species composition) changes radically, trapping the fishery into a regime in which high-valued commercial species cannot recover. These dynamics are often characterized by cascading effects across multiple trophic levels in marine food webs. Both top-down and bottom-up drivers contribute to the collapse of commercial fisheries. Overfishing is the main top-down driver, and is associated with indirect drivers that maintain fishing effort despite variation on fisheries demand, such as number of fishing boats in a fleet and fishing quotas that are insensitive to stock variation, as well as indirect drivers which increase fishing effort, such as demand from new markets, new possibilities to export fish, and technology improvements. The chief bottom-up drivers of collapse are drivers that influence the productivity of the base of marine food web. These include both anthropogenic and natural climate change that can shift the intensity and frequency of upwelling of cool nutrient rich water. Other factors, such as diseases spread, changes in ocean circulation, winds and temperature variation can act as synergistic factors contributing to collapses. The collapse of a commercial fishery can have substantial economic and social impacts.</p>","Harvest and resource consumption, External inputs (eg fertilizers), Adoption of new technology, Species introduction or removal, Disease, Global climate change",Fisheries,"Marine & coastal, Freshwater lakes & rivers","Primary production, Nutrient cycling",Biodiversity,Fisheries,,"Recreation, Aesthetic values, Knowledge and educational values","Food and nutrition, Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values, Cultural identity",,"Local/landscape, National (country), Sub-continental/regional","Years, Decades","Irreversible (on 100 year time scale), Hysteretic","Models, Paleo-observation, Contemporary observations, Experiments",Contested – Reasonable evidence both for and against the existence of RS,"Contested – Multiple proposed mechanisms, reasonable evidence both for and against different mechanisms","Bivalves Collapse, Hypoxia, Marine food webs, Marine eutrophication, Freshwater Eutrophication","<p>During the 20th century global fisheries greatly expanded in terms of effort and range. This expansion resulted in the overfishing of many fish stocks, and in some cases triggered fisheries collapses, for example the collapse of the highly productive Newfoundland cod fishery (Worm et al. 2009). While overfishing can severely deplete fish stocks, it will not necessarily trigger a fisheries collapse. A collapse occurs when once fishery pressure has been removed, stocks fail to rebuild (Hutchings 2000, Kirby et al. 2009), suggesting that the system has become locked into an alternate regime. In this case, alternate regimes are usefully conceptualized as alternative food web structures:</p> <p><strong>High abundance of a commercial fish species. </strong></p> <p>In this regime a valuable fish species is common and the fishery is highly productive. The main ecosystem services associated with high abundance of commercial fish are the production of food in first place, employment for both artisanal and industrial fishermen; followed by pest and disease regulation by healthy food webs, recreational values as recreational fishing, knowledge and educational values, as well as maintenance of biodiversity.</p> <p><strong>Low abundance of the commercial fish species. </strong></p> <p>This regime is characterized by a substantially reduced abundance of the valuable fish species. In cases where the valuable fish species performs key ecological functions, it can lead to trophic cascades that lead to an overabundance of planktivorous fish or primary producers such as seagrass, macroalgae, sponge or phytoplankton (Jackson et al. 2001). With low fish abundance, food production is the most immediate ecosystem services affected. While industrial fishermen often can move and harvest new areas or new species, artisanal fishermen often can lose their livelihoods and traditions. &nbsp;</p>","<p>There are two key direct drivers of fisheries collapse: overfishing as a top-down disturbance, and the change in nutrients input as a bottom-up disturbance.</p> <p>Overfishing reduces the population size of commercial fish species, reduces their ability to perform their functional role in the ecosystem, can destabilize their population dynamics (Anderson et al. 2008), and ultimately could change the structure of the food web. Nutrient inputs, on the other hand, affect fisheries by increasing the abundance of lower trophic levels e.g. phytoplankton and zooplanktivores such as jellyfish (Daskalov et al. 2007). Such changes in food web configuration can reduce the energy transfer to fish and hence reduce fishing productivity. These drivers can reduce the resilience of a regime making it more vulnerable to other types of regime shift, such as climate driven food web reorganization [see: Climate &amp; Marine Food Webs]. The indirect drivers that explain overfishing and changes in nutrient input interact in synergistic ways, making their identification a challenging process (Ocean Studies Board 2006, Kirby et al. 2009).</p> <p>Indirect drivers of overfishing include oversupply of fishing boats, inflexible fishing quotas, demand for fish, the development of new fishing technologies, the facilitation of trade (market connectivity), governance failures such as the failure of regulation to halt illegal fishing, and market failures such as subsidies or perverse incentives. Nutrient enrichment of marine ecosystems is also indirectly driven by runoff of fertilizer nutrients from agriculture and sewage from urban areas (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008).</p>","<p>A fishery collapses when a high-valued commercial species is substantially depleted and fails to immediately recover when fishing effort is removed (Hutchings 2000). It is usually associated with a substantial and persistent change in the structure of the marine community. Such a change involves changes in the species presence, their relative abundance, size and age.</p> <p>When the stock of commercial species decreases or even disappears the populations of other similar species may increase. Many commercially fished species are predatory fish, such as tuna, that have a high trophic level. Removing such top predators can cause a trophic cascade to reshuffle a food web (Daskalov et al. 2007, Estes et al. 2011), especially if there are not ecologically similar species present. Such trophic cascades, can increase fish stocks of prey species (Walters and Kitchell 2001), which can in turn lead to either sequential depletion of fish stocks or the development of new fisheries (Essington et al. 2006).</p> <p>The low abundance of commercial fish species can be maintained by a number of mechanisms. First, when the population of the commercial fish species falls under certain levels their population growth rate can decline from a variety of causes. This is known as depensation in fisheries, or the Allee effect more generally (Liermann and Hilborn 1997). Such an effect can occur if small schools of fish offer poorer protection from predators, smaller populations are less able to hunt or detect food, or mating success rates can decline.</p> <p>Second, nutrient enrichment can favor the food web shifts towards zooplanktivores, such as jellyfish. By reducing resources for other fish, the rise of such species can suppress fisheries recovery. Fishery pressure on filter-feeding fishes like sardine exacerbates the problem by favoring jellyfish outbreaks (Jackson et al. 2001, Brotz et al. 2012, Condon et al. 2013).</p> <p>Despite evidence from some well-documented cases, the degree to which fisheries declines are regime shifts remains a controversial issue for a number of reasons (Hilborn 2007, Litzow and Urban 2009). First, time series for most fisheries are only available from 1950, a time when marine ecosystems were already affected by flourishing industrial fishing, and some stocks had already been seriously depleted, especially those of large marine vertebrates like whales, manatees, crocodiles, seals, swordfish, sharks and rays (Kirby et al. 2009). This lack of long term data makes it difficult to identify causation in fisheries time series. Furthermore, marine ecological diversity and food web complexity complicates the detection of changes in fish populations due to fishing, because the signals of regime shift dynamics are small relative to ecological variation (Liermann and Hilborn 1997).</p>","<p><strong>Shift from high to low abundance of commercial fish species</strong></p> <p>Since 1950 the world marine fisheries catch has expanded almost fivefold, and is currently about 80 million tonnes of fish. According to FAO, about 30% of fish stocks are overexploited, 60% are fully exploited and about 10 % are not fully exploited (FAO 2012). Global marine fish catches have plateaued and are not expected to increase. Local fisheries decline has been estimated to have affected the employment of roughly 14 million fishermen, 12 million of which correspond to artisanal fisheries (Pauly et al. 2006). There is not clear assessment of the number of stocks that have collapsed but FAO suggests about 5% of fish stocks are depleted (FAO 2012). Some collapsed stocks have remained at under 10% of their previous sizes even after decades of fishing closure (Ainley and Blight 2009). Food production, primary productivity, pest regulation, and cultural services are the ecosystem services most affected by the collapse of fisheries. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Shift from low to high abundance of commercial fish species</strong></p> <p>An abundant fish population regime will likely better maintain marine biodiversity and will be more resilience to climate variation and climate change. Society will benefit of high abundance regime in terms of high primary productivity that translate in more food, jobs and livelihoods in small coastal communities. It will also better regulate marine hypoxia.</p>","<p>A review of marine fisheries in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment offer a synthetic set of managerial options for addressing fisheries collapse (Pauly et al. 2006).</p> <p><strong>Options for enhancing resilience </strong></p> <p>There are two types of strategies for enhancing resilience. The first is to stop doing things that are eroding resilience, while the second is to being activities that build resilience. There are a number of fishing practices that could be eliminated because they damage the resilience of fisheries. For example, fishing practices that destroy habitat such as bottom trawling should be avoided. Developing alternative technologies and reduction of fishing effort are suggested. Bycatch, the killing but not consuming of unwanted fish, can also have substantial impacts and can be reduced. Indirectly, fisheries subsidies and inflexible quotas can drive fishing effort to high levels that erode the resilience of a fishery.</p> <p><strong> Options for reducing resilience of unwanted regime to encourage restoration or transformation</strong></p> <p>Direct resilience building strategies include the establishment of Marine protected areas (MPAs) (Takashina and Mougi 2014). These areas can play an important role by providing refugia for fish and increasing ecological diversity. Research suggests that they need to cover ecologically significant areas, including different habitats, ensuring connectivity among them. However there remains controversy over the extent to which MPAs shift fishing pressure to less protected sites.</p> <p>Indirect resilience building efforts include efficient regulation and policing of fishing can reduce illegal fishing, while comprehensive fisheries policies at the international and national level can also build resilience if they result in fisheries policies that reinforce one another. Indirect resilience building strategies include improving the ability of fishers to exit fisheries.</p> <p>Good management of fishing pressure has been able to restore fisheries stocks. For example, in the US fishing closures and implementation of management measures for bottom fishing have enabled the restoration of George Bank haddock, Atlantic scallops, George Bank yellowtail flounder, Atlantic striped bass, Atlantic Arcadian redfish, Pacific chub mackerel, and Pacific sardine. However, there is no clear strategy that works across many ecosystems or nations (Beddington et al. 2007).</p>","(#1) Ainley, D. G., and L. K. Blight. 2009.

136,10/3/14 0:00,Mangrove transitions,Juan Carlos Rocha,Reinette (Oonsie) Biggs,"<p>Mangroves are ecosystems adapted to the mixture of salt and fresh water in coastal areas. They provide important ecosystem services such as carbon storage, storm protection, ground fields for several marine species, water cleansing, and wood for construction and energy. Despite their importance for both local communities and the global carbon budget, mangroves are at risk of collapsing in tropical areas of the world while they are likely to expand on temperate areas. World&rsquo;s mangrove cover has been reduced by 30% during the last 50 years mainly driven by aquaculture, deforestation, land cover change towards agricultural fields, shrimp farming, salt extraction or urban development, as well as by infrastructure development changing the water salinity. In the coming century, climate change is expected to add pressure to this ecosystem by increasing sea level rise and changing the distribution of extreme weather events such as storms and droughts with impacts on the balance between salt and fresh water. In temperate areas climate change is expected to raise temperature enough for mangroves development in areas currently dominated by salt marshes. Managerial options include identifying areas where these ecosystems have potential for expansion and migration, reduce human pressure on them and assist them by monitoring drivers and implementing marine protected areas.</p>","Vegetation conversion and habitat fragmentation, Harvest and resource consumption, External inputs (eg fertilizers), Infrastructure development, Environmental shocks (eg floods), Global climate change","Urban, Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Timber production, Fisheries, Conservation, Tourism",Marine & coastal,"Soil formation, Water cycling",Biodiversity,"Fisheries, Wild animal and plant products, Timber, Woodfuel","Climate regulation, Water purification, Water regulation, Regulation of soil erosion, Natural hazard regulation","Recreation, Aesthetic values","Food and nutrition, Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values",,Local/landscape,"Years, Decades",Unknown,"Models, Paleo-observation, Contemporary observations, Experiments",Well established – Wide agreement in the literature that the RS exists,"Contested – Multiple proposed mechanisms, reasonable evidence both for and against different mechanisms","Coral Transitions, Seagrass transitions, Hypoxia, Fisheries collapse, Marine eutrophication","<p>Mangroves are ecosystems adapted to the mixture of fresh and salt water common in intertidal zones of marine coastal environments. Mangroves cover between 1.7-1.8 x 105 km<sup>2</sup> globally. They develop within 30&ordm;N and 38&ordm;S and grow optimally between 15&ordm;C and 25&ordm;C (Lovelock 2008). Outside this geographical and thermal range mangroves show reduced leaf formation and above 38&ordm;C or below freezing temperatures they do not photosynthesize (Mcleod and Salm 2006; Cavanaugh et al. 2014). Mangrove ecosystems are often used by local communities who depend on fishing and timber harvesting.</p> <p><strong>Mangrove forest </strong></p> <p>Mangrove forest is characterized by an ensemble of species with aerial roots adapted to survive in environments where water salinity and tides are highly variable. Mangroves grow in tropical and subtropical waters, where the optimal temperature range is between 15-24&ordm;C. Different species occur under different salinity gradients and some trees reach 40m high in areas with high precipitation. Mangroves usually establish in soil enriched by the sediment discharge of rivers (Mcleod and Salm 2006). Mangroves are ecologically important because they provide habitat for many marine species at some stages of their lifespan, increasing both marine and terrestrial biodiversity.</p> <p><strong>Salt marshes, rocky tidal, shrimp farms. </strong></p> <p>Mangroves can become dominated by salt marshes or other configuration of coastal wetlands depending on the substrate, sediment deposition and the topography (Mcleod and Salm 2006). The alternative regime once a mangrove has collapsed is not straightforward. It strongly depends on the land use, topological characteristics, latitude and the history of the system disturbance (Cavanaugh et al. 2014). For example, many mangroves around the world have been converted into ponds for shrimp farming, salt extraction, or simply dry out to establish agriculture, cattle ranching, infrastructure development or human settlements.</p>","<p>The main drivers of mangrove collapse have typically been land use/cover change during the last 50 years. One third of world&rsquo;s mangroves have been lost due to overexploitation of forest resources (deforestation) or conversion into agriculture, salt extraction, or ponds for shrimp farming (Cavanaugh et al. 2014). Other threats to mangroves include the development of infrastructure (roads, dams), the diversion of fresh water for irrigation and the development of urban areas. These impacts are typically stronger in developing countries where it is expected that mangroves will decline 25% by 2025 (Mcleod and Salm 2006), while recent studies show that mangrove areas are declining 1-2% yearly (Duke et al. 2007; Alongi 200; Cavanaugh et al. 2014).</p> <p>Current climate change is also expected to affect mangroves via the increase in frequency and severity of storms, floods and droughts (climate extreme events), the increase of temperature, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. Frequent extreme events that potentially decrease the flow of fresh water will increase salinity, putting stress on some species and reducing their growing rates and seedling survival (Mcleod and Salm 2006). Precipitation increase, on the other hand, could favor mangrove over salt marshes by decreasing salinity and giving a competitive advantage to mangroves (Cavanaugh et al. 2014). However, strong storms and flooding events could prevent mangroves from respiring when their aerial roots are underwater. Although temperature is expected to increase 2-6&ordm;C before 2100, its effect on mangroves is contested. On the one hand, a 6&ordm;C increase would heterogeneously affect mangroves around the world, although it is likely to induce thermal stress, it won&rsquo;t be strong enough to surpass the temperature tolerance of these ecosystems. An increase in temperature will increase the melting rate of ice and expand the volume of world&rsquo;s oceans increasing the level of the sea. On the other hand, it has also been observed that warming on the coldest time of the year can favor mangroves over taking salt marshes in temperate areas of the planet, with a suggested threshold of -4&ordm;C for Florida (Cavanaugh et al. 2014).</p> <p>Sea level rise is perhaps the most important threat to mangroves. While the expected sea level rise projection range from 0.09 to 0.88 m (or 0.9 to 8.8 mm per year) several studies report that mangrove ability to migrate upwards range from 1.2 to 4.5mm per year (Mcleod and Salm 2006). Although faster migration has been observed in Holocene stratigraphic records for Florida, migration also depends of local topological conditions. Increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide could increase mangroves growth but also ocean acidification. While the increase in growth is not expected to be strong enough to overcome the pressure of sea level rise, acidification is expected to have an indirect effect on mangroves by reducing coral reefs accretion, increasing in turn the erosive effects of waves on mangrove soils (Mcleod and Salm 2006).</p>","<p><strong>Shift from mangroves to salt marshes, rocky tidal or shrimp ponds.</strong></p> <p>By having aerial roots mangroves adapt to very specific conditions where salt and fresh water meets in coastal zones. Mangroves build up carbon rich soils also known as peat, which favors further mangrove growth.</p> <p>Loss of mangrove area decreases peat production. Peat is lost by wave erosion and reduces the likelihood of recovery of mangrove forest. Mangrove area loss is mainly driven by conversion to agriculture, urban settlements, overexploitation of wood, shrimp farming, salt extraction, or infrastructure development (e.g. roads, dams, water divergence to irrigation) (Cavanaugh et al. 2014). Human perturbations are maintained by social feedbacks such as demand for food and market access, population growth and the cumulative benefit of human settlements (higher provision of services). In contrast, communities with poor services access such as electric energy or gas for cooking strongly rely on mangrove wood as source of energy and construction material (Mcleod and Salm 2006).</p> <p>If sea level rise occurs faster than the ability of mangroves to build up peat or migrate to higher areas, mangrove forests will disappear in major areas of the world (Alongi 2008). Both the impact of sea level rise and mangrove&rsquo;s ability to adapt depend on local conditions and are highly uncertain. For example, mangroves in carbonate substrates (such as coralline islands) and microtidal systems (short tidal change from high to low) are less likely to adapt and migrate as climate change continues. Mangroves in rich soil substrates and macrotidal systems are more likely to migrate if salinity balance and sedimentation do not overcome their tolerance range (Mcleod and Salm 2006). &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Shift from salt marshes to mangroves</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>Mangroves have also been observed to migrate pole wards colonizing habitats previously dominated by salt marshes (Cavanaugh et al. 2014). The shift occurs when the minimum temperature in winter increase for a longer period of time, giving mangroves an advantage to over compete salt marshes. It has been observed in areas such as Florida, Louisiana or Australia. Although there is uncertainty regarding the mechanism, the threshold is thought to be related with the number of days that minimum temperatures are colder than -4&ordm;C, at least for Florida case (Cavanaugh et al. 2014). The authors of the Florida study also report that it&rsquo;s unlikely that local scale drivers such as nutrients inputs, sedimentation or hydrology have had a determinant effect on the shift. However, sea level rise has contributed to increasing mangrove area (since it has happen slowly enough) and other common driver of the shift can reduce mangrove accretion such as coastal development, aquaculture and timber production (Cavanaugh et al. 2014).</p>","<p>Mangroves provide a variety of ecosystem services. Mangrove ecosystems provide habitat for economically important marine species for fishing (e.g. shrimp or lobster among other crustaceans and mollusc), and they provide&nbsp;habitats for important groups of terrestrial species such as reptiles, monkeys, and birds. They are therefore important for maintaining both marine and terrestrial biodiversity. Mangroves also provide fuelwood, charcoal, and wood for construction. As a forest it provides protection against storms, floods, river born siltation and also traps water pollutants and sediments, reducing the erosive action of waves, particularly protecting adjacent ecosystems such as coral reefs, and sea grass beds (Duke et al. 2007). Mangroves have also been shown to play a key role in the global carbon budget, capturing up to 15% of global carbon and exporting up to 11% of particular terrestrial carbon to the oceans (Alongi 2014). In fact, recent studies support the hypothesis that mangroves are able to capture and store carbon in a greater extend that terrestrial ecosystems (Lovelock 2008), nearly identical to those of tropical forest (Alongi 2014). Therefore, losing mangrove area implies the loss of carbon storage.</p> <p>While in the short term local communities could benefit by converting mangroves into shrimp farms, agriculture fields, or using its wood; in the long term they mean the loss of important services such as coastline protection, biodiversity important for tourism and fishing, water cleansing and carbon storage (Ewel et al. 1998; Cavanaugh et al. 2014). In fact, their services has been valued over $1.6 trillion per year (Costanza et al. 1997).</p>","<p>McLeod et al. (2006) propose a series of tools to monitor and plan for mangroves adaptation to climate change. First they propose to assess mangrove vulnerability based on the local conditions. Management options for mangrove forests are highly context dependent. As the main threat to mangroves is climate change through sea level rise, mangrove ecosystems will likely migrate upwards and northwards (Cavanaugh et al. 2014). However, such migration is constrained by local conditions such as substrate types, infrastructure development, sediment input and changes in salinity.</p> <p>Second, they propose to apply risk-spreading principles (Duke et al. 2007) and identify areas that are likely to be sources and sinks of the migratory process (Mcleod and Salm 2006). &nbsp;By identifying the role of each mangrove patch, it is easier to prioritize where green belts are needed to increase connectivity, which patches should be protected and which patches are more likely to respond to restoration efforts. They emphasize the importance of establishing a baseline and monitoring program with local communities in order to assess the main drivers locally. Developing partnerships with local stakeholders and developing alternative livelihoods for mangrove dependent communities are key managerial efforts (Mcleod and Salm 2006). The resilience of mangroves to future climate change scenarios also depend on how successful management efforts are at reducing the influence of other drivers: deforestation, overexploitation, infrastructure development, divergence of water for irrigation, and urbanization. Management of such local forcing will increase resilience to regional forcing such as increasing storm events or ocean acidification.</p> <p>Third, it has been suggested that policy and market-based are critical to foster conservation efforts, reduce mangrove encroachment and maintain carbon storage through funding mechanisms such as REDD or other payment for ecosystem services schemes (Hutchison et al. 2013). Effective governance structures and education has also been suggested as managerial strategies (Duke et al. 2007).</p>","(#1) Alongi, D. M. 2008.

If a harvester is overharvesting (a defector), he/she is ostracised by the community, for example by obstructing their access to necessary machinery or to market, which encourages the defector to co-operate by harvesting at a lower, socially optimal level. The alternative regimes are (1) high co-operation and resource levels and (2) overharvesting. Key drivers include resource inflow, the effectiveness of the ostracism norm, and the cost of harvesting.

A number of factors could drive this shift. Increasing resource level, for example due to increased inflow, can lead to ineffective ostracism because at higher resource levels defection becomes more attractive by providing higher gains from resource over-extraction. Increasing defector payoff compared to ostracism, for example due to decreased costs or decreased ostracism strength, could also lead to defection becoming increasingly attractive.</p> <p><strong>Shift from ‘Over-harvesting’ to ‘Co-operation and sustainable resource levels’ </strong></p> <p>Reversal of any of the above trends can cause a shift from over-harvesting to co-operation: decrease in resource levels, for example due to decreased inflow; increased costs; or increased ostracism strength.</p>","<p>Co-operation and sustainable resource levels occur when there is sufficient social capital to ostracise defectors and thereby make defection less attractive than co-operation. The key negative feedback that keeps the regime stable is the following: if the fraction of cooperators increases the social capital and hence strength of ostracism increases which reduces the utility of defectors, making defection less attractive. At the same time, however, resource productivity increases which increases the utility of defectors, so stability ultimately depends on the respective strength of the two feedback loops.</p> <p>The over-harvesting regime exists when there are only few cooperators and hence there is insufficient social capital to ostracise defectors. The feedback that maintains full defection is as follows: any agent that 'co-operates' (i.e. harvests at a lower level) will have a payoff substantially less than the defectors. In the absence of social capital to encourage co-operation through ostracism, the co-operator will switch back to defection. The key threshold for a collapse in co-operation is when the costs of ostracism are lower than the benefits of overharvesting, i.e. ostracism ceases to be an effective mechanism to discourage defection. A variety of drivers can cause this shift, as discussed below.</p> <p>To trigger a transition from full defection back to co-operation, co-operation must become more attractive than defection. This could be achieved by increasing the costs of harvesting, or by decreasing the level of the resource to low levels so that the benefits of overharvesting are minimal.

Marine eutrophication processes differ from lakes due to the open physical structure of the sea, higher diversity of biotic habitats and more complex hydrological structure. Increases in nutrients (both nitrogen and phosphorus) increase primary production, leading to a higher turbidity, and may threaten ecosystem stability and animal as well as human health. Decomposition of the increased biomass results in increased consumption of oxygen in deep water, which may lead to hypoxia and anoxic bottoms with severe consequences for benthic organisms. Light availability can become too low to sustain macroalgae and/or submerged plants.</p> <p>Scientific knowledge on the eutrophication is considerable and major commitments have been made to reduce eutrophication. These include institutional arrangements, nutrient reduction goals, assessment of progress and second-generation goals.

An oligotrophic coastal system has clear water and often submerged vegetation. Commercially preferred fish species may be abundant, because coastal ecosystems support many fisheries and are highly productive due to the nutrients from the land via runoff, or deep ocean via upwelling (Boesch 2002). Many seas experience some natural hypoxia/anoxia and eutrophication, but in smaller extent and shorter time period than in the eutrophic regime. The limited amount of nutrients keeps the growth of primary production and algal blooms restricted.</p> <p><strong>Eutrophic regime </strong></p> <p>Estuaries and coastal marine ecosystem receive anthropogenic pollutants rapidly from rivers and streams from drainage basins. In eutrophic marine ecosystems phytoplankton and epiphytic algae biomass, as well as nuisance blooms of gelatinous zooplankton, have increased. Changes in species composition can take place in all trophic levels. Phytoplankton species may have shifted to taxa that are toxic or inedible. Animal species composition often changes to include less recreationally and commercially desired species. Macroalgal and vascular plants can experience changes in biomass and species composition or disappear completely. (Smith et al. 1999; Smith 2003)</p> <p>Eutrophic regime causes economic losses due to restoration and damaged goods and health threats to humans exposed to algal toxins. Water clarity is reduced and humans perceive the water overall as less aesthetic.</p>","<p>Eutrophication commonly takes place in marine coastal waters (Smith et al. 1999; Cloern 2001). The primary cause of marine eutrophication is excessive increase in nutrient concentration (Nixon 1995) from riverine loads, originating from fertilized agricultural areas, urban sewage and industrial wastewaters (e.g. Bonsdorff et al. 1997). The nutrient loads from land to sea have been successively increased as a result of land clearing, population growth, industrial development, increased use of fossil fuels and increased use of fertilizers in agriculture (Boesch 2002). In addition, oceanic upwelling transports nutrient-rich waters to water surface and atmospheric nitrogen can enter the ocean (Boesch 2002; Paerl 1997). Estuaries may be naturally eutrophic as the nutrient loads from land are concentrated in confined channels, but cultural eutrophication often increases the nutrients significantly. In marine systems nitrogen is usually the key limiting nutrient (Borysova et al. 2005), but the limiting nutrient might differ between locations.</p> <p>Also other human impacts contribute to the changes observed in many coastal areas (Cloern 2001), such as fishing (removal of top-predators causing food web reorganizations). For instance in the Black Sea the intense eutrophication is suggested to result from the combination of nutrient inputs, low grazing pressure on phytoplankton and favorable climatic influences (Llope et al. 2011). Climate change is projected to intensify eutrophication by potentially increasing the water temperature and thereby strengthening the vertical stratification potentially leading to larger deep anoxic water volumes or by increasing the discharge due to higher rainfalls (Justic et al. 2009). Local characteristics of the sea, such as water residence time, stratification and tides affect the intensity of eutrophication and the ecosystem vulnerability to it (Cloern 2001; Justic et al. 2009).</p>","<p>The biological growth and algal blooms in an oligotrophic sea are restricted by the limited availability of nutrients, in particular nitrogen and phosphorus. Diverse processes tend to regulate algal growth in coastal environments, for instance herbivores control algal biomass and elevated oxygen concentrations suppress recycling of nitrogen and phosphorus (Kemp et al. 2005).</p> <p>In summary, nutrient addition increases algal biomass and after substantial nutrient loading affects bottom-water oxygen and nutrient recycling, water clarity and benthic primary production (Kemp et al. 2005). Biomass increases lead to a high remineralisation of organic matter at the sea bottom leading to a drecrease in oxygen concentration (Borysova et al. 2005). Oxygen within sulphates is used by bacteria, resulting in the release of sulfur that will capture the free oxygen still available in the upper layers. Sulfur also causes the specific smell of sediments in eutrophic water. As the deep water oxygen concentration decrease towards anoxic conditions, benthic orgranisms will decrease and eventually disappear.</p> <p>Positive feedback loops are found in nutrient recycling and water clarity. In the nutrient feedback loop, increase in nitrogen and phosphorus increase the amount of algae and turbidity, which decreases oxygen concentration in deep water, leading to lower redox and denitrification processes. This causes increased recycling of nutrients (ammonium, phosphate), and increases the nutrient availability causing a higher phytoplankton biomass. In the coastal water clarity feedback the increased turbidity and abundant phytoplankton leading to less light and benthic production, which results in less nitrogen and phosphorus uptake and increased resuspension, which inhibit the growth of seagrass once again means more algae and turbidity. (Kemp et al. 2005, Nystr&ouml;m et al. 2012).</p>","<p>In eutrophic systems nutrient availability regulates primary production levels. The increased occurrence of harmful algal blooms are of great concern in marine systems (Smith et al. 1999). Provisioning ecosystem services are lost when toxins cause mortality of both wild and farmed fish as well as shellfish, and other animals. The composition and structure of food webs may be altered (Caddy 1993; Smith et al. 2006), potentially affecting the resilience of the coastal ecosystem. Damage and destruction of habitats (e.g. Kemp et al. 2005; Walker et al. 2001; Andersen &amp; Rydberg 1988) and weakened quality of nursery and spawning grounds (Borysova et al. 2005) cause commercial fish species to migrate away or die.</p> <p>Over half of the world population lives within coastal areas and most of the world's fisheries are connected to estuaries and near-shore habitats (Smith 2003 ref. Hobbie 2000), making the marine eutrophication a serious problem. Humans experience illness or even mortality due to contaminated fish and seafood and harmful algal blooms. Economic losses are caused by water quality problems, expenditures undertaken to reduce or avoid the damaging effects, damage on market goods and decreased tourism (Committee on the Causes and Management of Eutrophication, Ocean Studies Board, Water Science and Technology Board 2000; Cloern 2001).</p>","<p><strong>Options for preventing the regime shift </strong></p> <p>Returning to the pristine, oligotrophic state is seldom a realistic option especially with continuation of anthropogenic nutrient inputs (Boesch 2002) and the human population growth. Eutrophication can be avoided, or restored, by defining a good ecological status for example in the European coasts through the implemented Water Framework Directive (WFD), for the system and the standards (nutrient reductions) needed to achieve it (Boesch 2002). The effect of current regulations to meet these standards is estimated and additional means to satisfy the established ecological goals identified, as was also done by the first assessment of the success of the WFD. Overall, the management strategy should be integrated to include for instance the catchment basin and atmospheric impact. The use of nutrients can be reduced already in the point of release and pollution should be removed before they end off at the sea. Ecosystem based fisheries management could improve the resilience of food-web against perturbations (Llope et al. 2011)</p> <p><strong> Options for restoration of desirable regimes </strong></p> <p>The key action to decrease eutrophication is limiting (Smith 2003; Smith et al. 2006; Conley et al. 2009) and most measures needs to be taken in the surrounding catchments. Commitments and organized efforts have been made in several regions to reverse eutrophication. Examples of institutional arrangements are regulations to reduce emissions, multinational directives for the national level such as the WFD, coastal management programs and educational efforts (Boesch 2002).</p> <p>Different ecosystems need separate, specific management frameworks including several sectors. Local to regional nutrient reduction programs are formed in combination of scientific knowledge and politics. Reductions can be done through wastewater treatment, emission regulations, increased efficiency of nutrient use in agriculture, reduced fertilizer use, manure management, enhancement of nutrient sinks and reduction of urban runoff (Boesch 2002).</p> <p>Estimation of progress requires observations, continuous monitoring of the nutrient sources and tracking the changes in the sea back to the particular action. A time lag of years may occur before the management effects can be seen in the sea, in particular as internal phosphorus loading from sediments continues. &nbsp;Modeling enables forecasting the future consequences for nutrient reduction for, for instance, water clarity, algal blooms and oxygen levels.

132,9/9/13 0:00,West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse,Johanna Yletyinen,Garry Peterson,"<p>Indication exists for a possible regime shift of collapsed West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) due to the warming climate. As the atmosphere and oceans warm as a result of&nbsp;global warming, ice sheets are predicted to shrink in size, resulting in raised sea level. The WAIS is a marine ice sheet, surrounded by floating ice shelves with the main part of the sheet below sea-level (Oppenheimer 1998). It is considered to be capable of past and future collapses bringing about several meters sea level rise (Mercer 1978; Oppenheimer &amp; Alley 2004). The two WAIS regimes consist of the intact ice sheet and disintegrated WAIS. The global warming-induced future WAIS collapse could cause a sea level rise of approximately 3-5 meters with significant societal and economic impacts. Marine fauna that is adapted to sea ice dynamics would be directly impacted through habitat changes, food web interaction alterations and shifts in marine isotherms (Rogers et al. 2012; Clarke et al. 2007).&nbsp;Many uncertainties remain about the mechanisms of the WAIS system, drivers of the observed change and future scenarios. It is suggested that the warming of the oceanic deep water currently causes significant basal melting and thinning of the ice sheet. A basin-scale ice model study, published in 2014, provides strong evidence that the collapse has already begun (Joughin et al. 2014.)</p>",Global climate change,"Conservation, Tourism, Land use impacts are primarily off-site (e.g. dead zones)","Rock and Ice, Planetary",Water cycling,Biodiversity,Fisheries,Climate regulation,"Recreation, Knowledge and educational values","Livelihoods and economic activity, Social conflict",,Sub-continental/regional,Centuries,Irreversible (on 100 year time scale),"Models, Paleo-observation, Contemporary observations",Contested – Reasonable evidence both for and against the existence of RS,"Speculative – Mechanisms have been proposed, but little evidence as yet",Greenland ice sheet collapse,"<p><strong>Intact WAIS</strong> (full glacial or modern interglacial)</p> <p>Antarctica is divided into two large ice sheets by the Transantarctic Mountains. A large part of Antarctic ice mass consists of the WAIS, which lies on a marine sediment-draped bed many hundreds of meters below sea level (Joughin &amp; Alley 2011; Bamber et al. 2009). Compared to the East Antarctic ice sheet, the WAIS has rapid ice flow and discharge (Anderson et al. 2002). Ice shelves, which form over the water and float permanently attached to the landmass, serve as buttresses for the inland ice streams of the ice sheets (permanent layer of ice covering land), and are vulnerable to environmental forcing. Ice volume is stable when the water entering and leaving the system are in balance; the net accumulation (mainly snow) balances losses (ice calving, basal melting at the ice sheet margins) (Ivins 2009). The stability of the marine ice sheet is created between local basal restraint of the inland ice and longitudinal stretching of the ice shelves (Joughin &amp; Alley 2011; Ivins 2009), meaning that the marine-based bottom topography, geometry of the interior part and stability of the buttressing ice shelves (Joughin &amp; Alley 2011) contribute to maintaining the regime of the intact WAIS. The Southern Ocean marine environment generally rich in diversity, whereas the Antarctic terrestrial environment is low in diversity and missing many taxonomic groups (Rogers et al. 2012). In this regime humans have harvested large marine mammals, fish and krill, the latter of which is in direct competition with higher trophic level species (summer breeding colonies) (Rogers et al. 2012). At the present the WAIS appears to be thinning and the extent of sea ice is increasing.</p> <p><strong>Disintegrated WAIS</strong> (extreme interglacial)</p> <p>Changed internal dynamics, such as complicated ice stream flow changes or natural climatic and oceanic forcing, create instability in the WAIS. Disintegration (collapse) of the WAIS means the nonlinear process, in which the ice sheet would flow at increasing rates into the ocean as its buttressing ice shelves diminish (O'Reilly &amp; ACOS 2013). In the absence of the WAIS, the area would be covered by a broad open sea, punctuated by islands (Scherer 1991). The changes are occurring now and the collapse of the WAIS appears to already be underway, but large uncertainty remains on the timing (Joughin et al. 2014; Joughin &amp; Alley 2011). The absence of the WAIS would affect local ecosystems adapted to the presence of ice, and due to the sea level rise, all global coastal ecosystems and coastal human habitats. Marine fauna adapted to the sea ice dynamics would be directly impacted through habitat changes and shifts in marine isotherms, and the changes could cascade to the higher trophic levels, and alter food webs (Rogers et al. 2012; Clarke et al. 2007). The absence of WAIS would leave broad, deep seaways (Joughin &amp; Alley 2011), increasing accessibility for fishing vessels and tourists.</p>","<p>Climatic and oceanic forces appear to cause the WAIS retreats. Geologic evidence shows that the Antarctic ice sheet has shrunk in the past when global temperatures were warmer, for instance during the late Quaternary period (see e.g. Barnes &amp; Hillenbrand 2010). There have been times when parts of the WAIS have been lost to the ocean, causing raised sea levels (Ivins 2009). According to the model by Pollard and DeConto (2009), a collapse from the modern conditions could occur when sub-ice ocean melting increase from 0.1 to 2 m yr<sup>-1</sup> under shelf interiors, and from 5 to 10 m yr<sup>-1</sup> near exposed shelf edges.&nbsp;The mechanisms leading to the WAIS collapse are still unclear. It has been suggested that the WAIS collapse could start by the intrusion of ocean water (i.e. sea level rise) between the ice sheet and the ground. As the grounding line retreats, a strong positive feedback would be triggered when ocean water undercuts the ice sheet and causes further separation from the bedrock (Oppenheimer 1998). This feedback with sea level changes driving further retreat is contested by other studies (Alley et al. 2007; Gomez et al. 2010).&nbsp;At present, main cause for the thinning of the WAIS ice mass is suggested to be the intrusion of relatively warm ocean water beneath the ice. Ice shelves are very sensitive to ocean temperature changes (Turner &amp; Overland 2009) and several studies (see e.g. Price et al. 2008; Thoma et al. 2008, Joughin et al. 2014) have shown that increased transport of warm subsurface water significantly contributes to the basal ice-shelf melt. The warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) protrudes into the ice shelves through submarine troughs (Bintanja et al. 2013) and produces large melt rates at the regions where it is able to access the sub-ice-shelf cavities (Jacobs et al. 1992). Although the upper layers of Southern Ocean have cooled, the subsurface sea has in fact warmed (Robertson et al. 2002). The reasons for the warming of the Southern Ocean are not completely know. It is probably caused by multiple processes, such as increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, shifts in Southern Annular Mode (SAM, a high-latitude mode, also called Antarctic Oscillation) and changes in sea currents.</p> <p>Other, less direct contributors to the regime shift found in literature are hydrofracturing of crevasses by surface melting water, changes in landscape (glacier behavior), wind forcing, ocean upwelling, tides and long period waves, changes in stratospheric ozone affecting atmospheric and ocean circulation, and intensification and southward migration of the Southern Ocean Westerlies due to the positive trend in the SAM (e.g. Thompson &amp; Solomon 2002; Goosse et al. 2008; Turner et al. 2009; Joughin et al. 2014).</p>","<p>In the intact WAIS regime there is variability in the system depending on the natural climate variation, but the rate and scale of the changes in ice mass are not as remarkable as in the second regime, and the ice volume is maintained by equal net balance. The WAIS icescape is at the present characterized by decrease in ice mass and increased sea ice extent. The most recent research indicates that the WAIS is changing significantly and rapidly, and at an accelerating rate (O'Reilly &amp; ACOS 2013; Abram et al. 2013; Joughin &amp; Alley 2011; Thomas et al. 2004; Velicogna &amp; Wahr 2006). West Antarctica is currently warming, and has been stated to be one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth (Bromwich et al. 2012; Steig et al. 2013).</p> <p>The possibility for the collapse of the WAIS has been debated in science since the 1970s (Notz 2009). It has been suggested that the WAIS retreats follow glacial and interglacial periods (Clark et al. 2002; Fairbanks 1989; Scherer 1991). The potential of the WAIS to collapse and the mechanisms leading and preventing it are still unclear, but the recent studies argue that the collapse is possible with small changes in the forces (Mercer 1978; Oppenheimer 1998; Vaughan 2008; Schoof 2007; Naish et al. 2009; Pollard &amp; DeConto 2009; Notz 2009).&nbsp;A basin-scale ice-flow model by Joughin et al. (2014) provided strong evidence that the early-stage collapse has already begun. Their model strengthens the argument that the losses are melt-driven and that melt-induced ice-shelf thinning reduces buttressing, creating far greater speedup and retreat through the grounding line retreat.&nbsp;Ice sheet thinning appears to take place through basal melting (i.e. on the underside of the ice shelves) (Pritchard et al. 2012; Joughin &amp; Alley 2011). The highest melting rates occur where the ice shelves interact with the warmest water. Increased atmospheric temperature and ocean temperature (possibly due to several factors such as global climate change, natural climate variation, ozone hole and changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation) cause intrusion of warmed ocean water beneath the ice shelf of the WAIS. Relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) protrudes into the ice shelves through submarine troughs and produces large melt rates at the ice/ocean interface, decreasing the volume of the ice mass. The estimations of the loss rate vary both regionally and for the whole continent, see for instance King et al. (2012). Although in some regions the ice sheet is thickening, the net balance is negative (e.g. Velicogna &amp; Wahr 2006).</p> <p>The mass loss of ice is expected to increase both in volume and rate in the future when the warm circumpolar deep water is able to reach further ice shelves (Rignot et al. 2011; Hellmer et al. 2012). Unlike in the Arctic and as an unusual feature in consideration to the global warming, the extent of the Antarctic sea ice has increased in the observed period starting from 1979 (Turner &amp; Overland 2009). Sea-ice expansion may be meltwater-induced (Bintanja et al. 2013). Meltwater from the ice shelves has lower density and thus accumulates in the top ocean layer (Price et al. 2008). This upper layer water gets fresher, and resulting cold halocline reduces the convective mixing, causing the atmosphere to cool and freeze the upper 100 m more easily (Bintanja et al. 2013).&nbsp;The subsurface ocean warming, mass loss of ice due to the basal melt and expanding sea ice may constitute a negative feedback loop (Bintanja et al. 2013; Zhang 2007). The fresh melt water has low density and thus accumulates in the top layer, stabilizing the ocean and resulting in less mixing between cold and warm water (Bintanja et al. 2013). The cold and fresh upper seawater layer is easier to cool by the atmosphere and freezes. This meltwater-induced sea ice expansion hinders the warm deepwater from mixing with the surface water. Another feedback, which is positive but at present contested, has been suggested to be formed by the raised sea level further undercutting the ice sheet and triggering its separation from the bedrock.</p>","<p>Humans mainly use the Antarctica for commercial fishing, conservation, research, and tourism. The Antarctic region also plays a remarkable role in the planetary functions. Shifting the regime to that of the fragmented WAIS would&nbsp;affect the regulating ecosystem services of the Antarctica, such as global climate and ocean circulation through ice and snow albedo, CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and icescape changes. The Southern Ocean has a rich biodiversity, and fisheries include krill and toothfish. The biogeochemical cycles of the Southern Ocean and the sea ice impact the structure and dynamics of the marine ecosystems (e.g. life cycles of organisms), especially the trophic levels that are adapted to the presence, seasonality and properties of ice (Massom &amp; Stammerjohn 2010; Arrigo 2002; Brierley &amp; Thomas 2002; Thomas et al. 2010; Eicken et al. 1995; Moline et al. 2008; Tynan 2010; Clarke et al. 2007; Rogers et al. 2012).&nbsp;Sea level rise may have severe impacts on&nbsp;coastal areas by submergence or increasing flooding and erosion, changing ecosystems, and increasing salinization&nbsp;(Nicholls et al. 2011).&nbsp;Fisheries management and accessibility would change due to the altered sea ice extent (Anon 2009).</p> <p>The absence of the WAIS would leave broad, deep seaways (Joughin &amp; Alley 2011) and&nbsp;result in forced displacement of coastal population and economy (Nicholls et al. 2011). The economic consequences depend on the time-scale: playing out over a century. The WAIS collapse would damage many coastal communities, whereas occurring over several centruries, the additional time would give possibilities to develop an appropriate risk-mitigation strategy (Dowdeswell et al. 2008; Mercer 1978; Joughin &amp; Alley 2011).&nbsp;Increased vessel access to more southern locations may have implications on the safety of ocean navigation (Anon 2009). Tourism, the largest commercial activity in the Antarctic, is predicted to increase due to the extended season with reduced sea ice thickness (Anon 2009).&nbsp;The increased human presence might be a threat to ecosystems, for instance winter ice has usually provided a relief from the fishing pressure.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","<p>Two new studies in 2014 state that since the WAIS has reached the early stage collapse phase, the shift is unstoppable (Joughin et al. 2014, NASA in press). Joughin et al. (2014) argue that it is difficult to foresee stabilization of the system unless CDW recedes sufficienty to reduce present level of melting.</p>","(#1) Abram NJ et al. 2013.

The key drivers are nutrient loading/eutrophication from e.g. agricultural run-off, and overfishing, which both cause slow changes in the system that eventually lead to a sudden collapse of the seagrass regime; or more abrupt shocks like physical disturbance, both anthropogenic and natural, and disease outbreaks that cause direct seagrass decline. Seagrass ecosystems provide valuable ecosystem services such as fishing grounds and coastal protection, which are lost when a shift occurs. Once the system has shifted into a new regime it is difficult or even impossible to restore it to its previous seagrass dominated state. Therefore ecosystem management should be focused on enhancing resilience in order to avoid a regime shift, e.g. limit nutrient input, reduce physical disturbance and prevent overfishing.</p>","Vegetation conversion and habitat fragmentation, Harvest and resource consumption, External inputs (eg fertilizers), Infrastructure development, Species introduction or removal, Disease, Environmental shocks (eg floods)","Fisheries, Tourism, Land use impacts are primarily off-site (e.g. dead zones)",Marine & coastal,"Primary production, Nutrient cycling",Biodiversity,"Fisheries, Wild animal and plant products","Climate regulation, Water purification, Regulation of soil erosion","Recreation, Aesthetic values","Food and nutrition, Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values",,Local/landscape,"Weeks, Months, Years","Irreversible (on 100 year time scale), Hysteretic","Models, Contemporary observations, Experiments",Well established – Wide agreement in the literature that the RS exists,Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism,"Hypoxia, Coral Transitions, Fisheries collapse, Marine food web changes, Coastal eutrophication","<p>Seagrass beds are marine ecosystems that can be found in the subtidal and intertidal zones in the majority of oceans worldwide (Orth et al. 2006). Regime shifts in these systems have been identified as a transition to either an algae dominated regime (Valentine and Duffy 2006; Burkholder et al. 2007; Nystr&ouml;m et al. 2012) or a barren sediment regime (van der Heide et al. 2007, 2011; Nystr&ouml;m et al. 2012), although most literature interchangeably describes these phenomena as seagrass decline and not regime shifts. Although this review uses a social-ecological systems lens, the focus lies on the shift in the ecosystem, and humans are considered as beneficiaries of ecosystem services and as drivers of system change.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Seagrass dominated regime</strong></p> <p>Healthy seagrasses form large beds, usually dominated by one seagrass species. They are considered ecosystem engineers as they significantly modify the abiotic conditions of their ecosystem to benefit their own success, by reducing current speed, stabilising sediments and creating oligotrophic conditions by trapping inorganic and organic material (Duarte 2002; Orth et al. 2006; Burkholder et al. 2007). Together with epiphytic algae seagrasses form the basis of complex food webs, making these systems highly productive (Valentine and Duffy 2006). Seagrass beds also support high biodiversity and provide important habitats, refuges and nursery grounds for a variety of species, many of which are commercially and ecologically important (Orth et al. 2006).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Algae dominated regime </strong></p> <p>This regime is characterised by dominance of macroalgae (algae attached to the bottom sediments that can form extensive beds), phytoplankton (free-living, planktonic algae) or epiphytic algae (algae growing on the surface of seagrass leaves), or a combination thereof (Cardoso et al. 2004; Burkholder et al. 2007). They are inherently superior competitors to seagrass, particularly in high nutrient conditions such as eutrophication (Valentine and Duffy 2006), which is a characteristic of this regime. Under such conditions seagrasses are prone to smothering by epiphytes and encroachment by opportunistic macroalgae that can form beds that are resistant to seagrass recolonisation (Valentine and Duffy 2006). Shallow waters tend to be dominated by macroalgae and epiphytes, while deeper areas are dominated by phytoplankton (Burkholder et al. 2007). In general this regime supports lower biodiversity as the variety of habitats associated with seagrass beds are not provided (Duarte et al. 2006).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Bare sediment regime </strong></p> <p>A third alternate regime is that of a barren sediment landscape (van der Heide et al. 2007, 2011; Nystr&ouml;m et al. 2012). The shift can occur due to extensive removal of seagrasses or sudden disease outbreaks causing large seagrass die-off (van der Heide et al. 2007, 2011). In this regime sediments can easily be re-suspended, causing high turbidity and light attenuation due to a reduction in, or depletion of, the seagrass engineering function (van der Heide et al. 2011). The benthic sediments are coarse in comparison to the seagrass regime and can seasonally host macroalgal beds. Biodiversity is low and the community structure different compared to seagrass beds, as the seagrass habitats are removed (Cardoso et al. 2004).</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Seagrass Beds to Algae Dominated Regime</strong></p> <p>The shift from seagrass beds to algal dominated state is driven by multiple stressors, but nutrient loading and overfishing stand out as key drivers (Burkholder et al. 2007). Seagrasses are dependent on high influx of light, oligotrophic conditions and sediment bottoms (Ekl&ouml;f 2008). In coastal waters eutrophication causes an increase of epiphytic or macroalgal biomass, while in shallow parts it will cause phytoplankton blooms, reducing light penetration to a level that will no longer sustain seagrasses but promote algal dominance (Orth et al. 2006; Burkholder et al. 2007). The drivers of eutrophication are anthropogenic, such as nutrient input from agriculture, aquaculture and sewage (Duarte 2002; Burkholder et al. 2011).</p> <p>There is evidence that altering food webs through overfishing has similar effects, or can further augment the effects of eutrophication, by reducing herbivory, thus releasing algae from the pressure of grazing which can lead to a shift in regimes (Heck Jr and Valentine 2007). Changes in food webs are in turn linked to increased coastal migration, tourism, increased unemployment rates and increased population in coastal areas (Ekl&ouml;f 2008).</p> <p>Another important driver is the sediment load in the water column since it contributes to turbidity, i.e. decreases light penetration. Erosion, coastal development and deforestation are the main drivers of increased sediment loading in the water column (Duarte 2002; de Boer 2007). Activities such as boating, anchoring, dredging and trawling can also affect seagrass beds negatively throughout a long period of time. They all cause water turbidity and resuspension of sediments as well as physical damage to the seagrasses. Resuspension of sediments can also lead to a release of nutrients, promoting algal growth (de Boer 2007).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Shift from Seagrass Beds to Barren Sediment Regime </strong></p> <p>Another shift that can occur is from seagrass beds to a barren sediment regime with increased turbidity and where seasonal macroalgae take over (Cardoso 2003). Drivers of this shift are mainly physical disturbances such as actual removal of beds from e.g. beach replenishment or dredging, and a wasting disease that can cause extensive seagrass die-off (Duarte 2002; Cardoso et al. 2004). These drivers are shocks to the system, thus it appears that the shift is more abrupt than the shift to the algae dominated state. Physical disturbance could either be anthropogenic, such as dredging, boating activities, trawling and various coastal developments; or natural, such as storms (Duarte 2002). Eutrophication can also be a driver for this shift, as in the Mondego estuary in Portugal, where the loss of seagrasses and their ability to bind sediments also resulted in a bare, coarse sediment regime (Cardoso et al. 2004).</p>","<p><strong>The seagrass regime and associated feedback loops</strong></p> <p>Seagrass beds occur under low nutrient, clear water conditions created by seagrasses modifying the abiotic environment to favour their own growth (Burkholder et al. 2007; de Boer 2007). Herbivory keeps algal abundance low and facilitates healthy seagrass beds. Feedbacks maintaining the seagrass bed regime are primarily seagrasses reducing turbidity through absorption of nutrients and sediment stabilisation. Thus, light conditions are improved which otherwise work as a limiting factor for seagrass growth (Burkholder et al. 2007). Additionally, the sediment stabilisation reduces the resuspension of nutrients in the water column, which further controls algal blooms and prevents eutrophication (Duarte 2002). These feedback loops maintain the seagrass dominated regime.</p> <p>External drivers can slowly undermine seagrass resilience by reducing the engineering function which hampers conditions for seagrass growth. This can eventually lead to a sudden shift to algal dominance due to a reversal of the aforementioned feedback loops once the thresholds have been crossed (Cardoso et al. 2004; Nystr&ouml;m et al. 2012). Such shifts show hysteretic behaviour. That is, a return to previous seagrass regime is difficult due to the alteration of feedback loops (Nystr&ouml;m et al. 2012) and the state can usually not be recovered by re-establishing previous environmental conditions (Scheffer et al. 2005).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Shift from Seagrass Beds to Algae Dominated Regime</strong></p> <p>The key drivers causing seagrasses to shift to an algal dominated regime are nutrient loading and overfishing (Valentine and Duffy 2006; Burkholder et al. 2007). Nutrient loading from agricultural run-off and sewage, will increase the available nutrients in the water column and possibly lead to a eutrophied state. Algae are superior competitors to seagrass under high nutrient levels and nutrient enrichment will therefore promote algal blooms (Duarte 2002; Valentine and Duffy 2006). This in turn decreases light conditions through an increase in turbidity by phytoplankton, shading by macroalgae and overgrowth (fouling) by epiphytic algae (Burkholder et al. 2007). Moreover, the phytoplankton blooms are further fuelled by decomposing algae and seagrasses as this releases nutrients into the water column (Ekl&ouml;f 2008). It is difficult to determine a threshold of critical nutrient concentration since it is case specific and depends on factors such as current velocity and herbivory (Valentine and Duffy 2006; Burkholder et al. 2007). A more specific threshold is light availability and if the conditions drop below seagrass tolerance it can cause the regime to shift (de Boer 2007); however, light tolerance is species-specific (Orth et al. 2006).</p> <p>Overfishing modifies community structure causing trophic cascades due to removal of top predators. This causes an increase in meso-predators which in turn will reduce herbivores through higher levels of predation. A reduction in herbivores releases epiphytic algae from grazing pressure, which leads to algal overgrowth on seagrasses. This eventually suffocates them by obstructing light, and since seagrasses engineer their own habitat the loss will make the environment less suitable for a recolonisation, due to resuspension of sediments (Heck Jr and Valentine 2006; Duarte 2002). Seagrass beds are dependent on grazers to feed on algae before they get too thick to be eaten (Heck Jr and Valentine 2006). The threshold in amount of herbivory is hard to identify but it can be reduced to the same threshold associated with light conditions (de Boer 2007). Herbivory is important as it enhances the resilience of seagrass beds to nutrient enrichment by keeping algal population in low abundance (Valentine and Duffy 2006).</p> <p>Once established, the algae dominated regime is maintained by the loss of seagrass engineering capacity which keeps the system in a high turbidity and nutrient state. Once macroalgal beds are established they are highly resistant to seagrass encroachment since they are better competitors under high nutrients levels (Valentine and Duffy 2006). In this regime oxygen depletion (anoxia) in the sediments is common due to higher levels of decomposing organic material and algal respiration as these processes consume oxygen, which eventually can result in hypoxia. This further prevents seagrass recolonisation as it causes an increase in hydrogen sulphide concentration in the sediments which is directly toxic to seagrasses. Such toxicity can also result in a decline in herbivores, thus reduce herbivore pressure (Burkholder et al. 2007) and further reinforce the algal dominance.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Shift from Seagrass Beds to Barren Sediment Regime </strong></p> <p>Both physical disturbance and diseases can remove extensive seagrass cover in one single event, which could eventually lead to a sudden collapse of the whole population and cause the regime shift (van der Heide et al. 2007). Although not specified, van der Heide et al. (2007) argue for the existence of a threshold in seagrass density below which the seagrass engineering function is severely reduced, thus causing high turbidity and poor light penetration. Hence, as which the shift to the algae regime, this can also be reduced to a threshold regarding the light availability. Such collapse has been observed in the seagrass Zostera marina in areas around the north Atlantic in the 1930's where extensive die-off of seagrass due to an outbreak of the wasting disease caused a shift to a barren sediment regime (Duarte et al. 2006). In the Dutch Wadden Sea the meadows have not yet recovered, which is believed to be due to a synergistic effect between the disease outbreak and subsequent eutrophication (van der Heide et al. 2007).</p> <p>The barren regime is reinforced by the reversed feedback loop that is created by the seagrass engineering function and otherwise maintains the seagrass regime. Without seagrass cover currents are not attenuated and sediments and nutrients are resuspended, which cause increased turbidity and light conditions below seagrass tolerance. It is therefore extremely difficult for seagrasses to recolonize once this regime is established (Cardoso et al. 2004; van der Heide et al. 2007). Furthermore, the increased current velocity renders a mobile and coarse bottom substrate that undermines seagrass root attachment, which can result in any new seedlings or remaining plants becoming uprooted (Cardoso et al. 2004). Surviving seedlings are also prone to fouling by epiphytic algae, as grazing pressure is low in young seagrass patches since they provide poor refuges from predators, and this further inhibits seagrass re-establishment (Valentine and Duffy 2006).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Uncertainties regarding climate change and regime shifts </strong></p> <p>The aspects of climate change that have been shown to affect regime shifts in seagrasses are sea level rise, increased CO2 and temperature rise (Short and Neckles 1999, Duarte 2002). But the connection to a regime shift remains speculative due to a lack of research (Short and Neckles 1999) and the fact that the outcome of climate change is co-dependent on other human activities in marine areas (Borum et al. 2004); most effects will vary spatially and depend on species in question. Temperature rise will affect photosynthesis in both algae and seagrasses and will depend on species thermal preference, but it has been shown that epiphytic algae growing on eelgrass will be favoured by higher sea temperatures (Short and Neckles 1999). Sea level rise will result in seagrasses losing their habitat and being forced to move in order to regain the light conditions needed and in addition the sea level rise will cause erosion that further will decrease light conditions for seagrasses (Short and Neckles 1999; Borum et al. 2004). An increase in CO2 levels might lead to an advantage for seagrass over algae since they require more CO2, but this is contested since evidence is weak (Borum et al. 2004). Most significantly, climate change will increase the risk for more extreme weather with more frequent and bigger storms which will cause sediment resuspension decreasing light conditions together with physical disturbance (Short and Neckles 1999; Duarte 2002).</p>","<p>Seagrass beds play a significant role in providing habitats and nursery grounds for marine organisms targeted for human consumption e.g. scallops, shrimps, crabs and juvenile fish (Duarte 2002; Terrados et al. 2004; Ekl&ouml;f 2008; Barbier et al. 2011).&nbsp; Thus, they are important habitats which enhance the welfare of people who directly are dependent on its resources (De la Torre-Castro et al. 2004). &nbsp;If seagrass beds are lost due to a regime shift, its provisioning ecosystem services may diminish, which can be detrimental for the well-being of dependent people, especially affecting provision of food and livelihood. Fishermen, whose main source of income comes from seagrass-associated species, may be the user group most affected by the regime shift (De la Torre-Castro et al. 2004).&nbsp;Seagrass beds play an important regulating role by capturing carbon dioxide and transforming it into organic carbon (Duarte, 2002; Orth et al. 2006; Barbier et al. 2011). It has been suggested that the carbon stored in living seagrasses globally is on average 2.52&plusmn;0.48 Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup> (Fourqurean et al. 2012). Seagrass bed decline could lead to a significant loss in the CO2 sequestration capacity and reduction in carbon storage, with potential negative effects at the global scale associated with climate change.</p> <p>Seagrass beds attenuate waves and stabilize sediments and in doing so reduce coastal erosion and erosion of bottom substrates (Duarte 2002; Orth et al. 2006; Ekl&ouml;f 2008; Barbier et al. 2011). They also can reduce the effects of storms and extreme weather events like hurricanes, providing a coastal protection service. It can be assumed that the lack of this service may affect the sense of security as material security of coastal populations and socio-economic activities in place such as fisheries, tourism, marine transport and aquaculture.&nbsp;In turn, fishing activity associated with seagrass beds benefit consumers by meeting food demand at local but also distant locations. In terms of access to enough nutritious food as a constituents of well-being (Reid et al. 2005), a regime shift may impact the adequacy of material for a good life of especially coastal communities. In addition, although in a limited way, some communities benefit from seagrass in that it is used as raw material and as food, as well as a fertilizer in some other regions (De la Torre-Castro et al. 2004; Barbier et al. 2011).Non-material services related to the aesthetic and cultural values of seagrass beds that benefits some traditional groups (Kenworthy et al. 2006; Barbier et al. 2011) could be lost if a regime shift takes place. Although tourism may threaten seagrass beds (Ochieng et al. as cited in Ekl&ouml;f 2008) they could have an overall positive effect on the tourist industry (Duarte 2002) by providing an aesthetic setting with high water clarity and habitats for diverse species (Barbier et al. 2011). Therefore, as regime shift resulting in a reduction of these services could have a potential negative effect on the tourism industry.</p>","<p>One of the most crucial management actions is to limit nutrient input. Important measures for doing this are limiting the use of fertilizers in agriculture; protecting marsh areas, as they can act as a buffer against nutrient loading; treating wastewater (Duarte 2002) and regulating its disposal so that it is discharged in areas with efficient water exchange. These measures are also effective for reducing organic matter loading. Human-provoked physical disturbance should also be controlled. For example, management should limit dredging and marine constructions to areas outside seagrass beds when possible, and should limit dredging and sand reclamation to short periods that seagrasses can overcome (Borum et al. 2004). Management should also regulate fishing activity in order to avoid overfishing on top-predators and prevent cascading effects in the food-web, which otherwise can lead to algal dominance (Ekl&ouml;f 2008). Efforts should also be made at an international scale to mitigate climate change (Borum et al. 2004). For an effective implementation of these measures, it would be necessary to increase public awareness about the ecological functions seagrass beds carry out and the services they provide to society (Duarte 2002; Orth et al. 2006; Ekl&ouml;f 2008).&nbsp;</p> <p>Once seagrass ecosystems have shifted into a new state, recovery can be difficult or even irreversible in human time scale (Duarte 2002; van der Heide et al. 2007). Therefore, it is preferable to maintain or to build the resilience of these systems to prevent a regime shift, as restoring them once a shift has occurred can prove difficult if not impossible (Orth et al. 2006).&nbsp;In the event of a regime shift it is possible to return to a seagrass-dominated regime by resorting to seagrass transplantations. However these techniques have high costs and the success rates are low (Duarte 2002; van der Heide et al. 2007) therefore regime shifts are best prevented (Orth et al. 2006).</p>","(#1) Barbier E.

121,8/23/13 0:00,Peatland transitions,Daniel Ospina,Helen Moor,"<p>Two alternate regimes in peatland systems are described in this document: bogs, sphagnum-dominated peatlands with long-term carbon storage in peat, and fens, peatland in which vascular plants have a more dominant role, leading to higher-productivity but reduced peat long-term accumulation. The most important variables and mechanisms considered are peat accumulation and height of the surface above the water table, nutrient flux, and competition between plant functional groups. The key drivers of the shift are related with changes in climate (precipitation and temperature) and in nutrient input. The relevance of this shift in terms of ecosystem services and human well-being is the tradeoff between potential gains of nutrient-rich soils for agricultural activities on drained peatlands, versus a loss of long-term carbon accumulation with potentially great implications for global climate change.</p>","External inputs (eg fertilizers), Environmental shocks (eg floods), Global climate change","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Large-scale commercial crop cultivation, Extensive livestock production (rangelands), Land use impacts are primarily off-site (e.g. dead zones)","Temperate & boreal forests, Tropical forests, Tundra","Soil formation, Primary production, Nutrient cycling",Biodiversity,"Food crops, Livestock, Fuel and fiber crops",Climate regulation,,Livelihoods and economic activity,,Local/landscape,"Years, Decades, Centuries",Hysteretic,"Models, Paleo-observation, Contemporary observations","Speculative – Regime shift has been proposed, but little evidence as yet",Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism,,"<p>Peatlands are characterized by often deep accumulations of incompletely decomposed organic material (i.e. peat). The accumulation of peat occurs when carbon sequestration exceeds the long-term loss through decomposition or export by hydrological flow. Such rates of decomposition can be very low in acidic and anaerobic conditions. Globally, peatlands occupy about four million km<sup>2</sup>, of which boreal and subarctic peatlands constitute about 87%, mainly in Russia, Canada, United States, Finland and Sweden. Tropical peatlands also exist, a big percentage of which is in Indonesia (Vitt, 2008). A major distinction within peatlands is between fens (minerotrophic peatlands: plants have access to geogenous water) and bogs (ombrotrophic peatlands: plants are dependent on precipitation). These and other differences in hydrology, acidity and climate produce a great variety of peatlands worldwide. Such variety in genesis and characteristics makes any generalization of peatlands functional values very difficult.&nbsp;A fen to bog transition is often seen as the natural course of peatland succession (Hughes &amp; Barber 2004), whereas a change from bog to fen usually requires external changes in conditions or strong perturbations. Both bogs and fens exhibit internal feedbacks that provide them with some stability, and threshold conditions associated with the transition between each other have been suggested in the literature (Belyea &amp; Malmer 2004).&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Bogs (Sphagnum-dominated peatland, with long-term carbon storage)</strong></p> <p>This regime is characterized by a landscape dominated by sphagnum-mosses, covering low hummocks and lawns, usually exhibiting no conspicuous spatial pattern in vegetation. Under the surface a thick layer of slow-decaying peat is mostly kept in waterlogged and acidic conditions. The concept of ecosystem engineers (Jones et al. 1994) has been used to describe Sphagnum mosses, given their functional capacity to create and maintain an acidic and nutrient-poor environment, harsh for most other plants (references in Ohlson et al. 2001). Additionally, mosses decay at extremely low rates due to their unique tissue chemistry, what strongly limits nutrient fluxes to other types of plants (Pastor et al. 2002). In the absence large external climatic changes or direct human impacts on hydrology or nutrient input, the species composition of these type of peatlands has proven to be very stable (references on Limpens et al. 2008).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Fens (Moss and vascular plant coexistence, with reduced peat accumulation)</strong></p> <p>Vascular plants also alter the environment in ways that negatively affect Sphagnum mosses. So an increase in vascular plant cover beyond critical thresholds inevitably leads to a decrease in Sphagnum (Berendse et al. 2001). Some of the mechanisms involved in this process act by preventing or even reversing ombrotrophication, in favor of minerotropic conditions. While other mechanisms might operate in bogs prompting the development of particular microtopography and associated vegetation spatial patterns. Such microtopography is also believed to be very stable (references in Eppinga et al. 2007 and in Limpens et al. 2008). This regime is characterized by an increasingly dense and connected vascular plants cover, exhibiting spatial patterns (strings-flarks on slopes and maze on flat landscapes) consisting of densely vegetated bands (hummocks forming ridges), alternating with wetter zones that are more sparsely vegetated (hollows forming pools) (Rietkerk et al. 2004).</p>","<p>A Sphagnum dominated peatland becomes more susceptible to invasion by vascular plants as the nutrient input increases (Pastors et al. 2002; Eppinga et al. 2007, 2009; Limpens et al. 2008). Ombrotrophic systems are particularly sensitive to nitrogen enrichment, which can prompt the invasion by graminoid species (e.g. Molinia caerulea) and woody species (e.g. Betula pubescens) with a parallel decline of ombrotrophic species (references in Tomassen et al. 2003). Sphagna are negatively&nbsp;affected by high nutrient input due to ammonium toxicity (Fritz et al. 2012). Additionally, related C:N ratio changes could enhance decomposition, further amplifying this nutrient positive relation with vascular plants.</p> <p>Decreasing wetness during the growing season promotes vascular plant growth and hampers moss development (Eppinga et al. 2007; Limpens et al. 2008), and perhaps more importantly, it weakens the nutrient flux delay of sphagnum peat by increasing aerobic decomposition (Hilbert et al. 2000). Reduced precipitation and droughts in general directly decrease Sphagnum productivity, as photosynthetic rates are strongly dependent on water saturation levels. Additionally, longer dry seasons can potentially increase wild fire frequency, with negative effects on peat depth (references in Limpens et al. 2008).&nbsp;In high latitude peatlands an increase in temperature implies a longer growing season for vascular plants and increases mineralization rates. As vascular plants abundance&nbsp;increases and Sphagnum cover reduces, the temperature feedback in regime 1 weakens, allowing for even warmer conditions in the rooting zone further increasing the growing season of vascular plants (references in Eppinga et al. 2007).</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Bogs to Fens</strong></p> <p>Different mechanisms are responsible for maintaining Bogs, mostly ombrotrophication, which is&nbsp;the ability of Sphagnum mosses to effectively decouple the rooting zone of vascular plants from geogenous mineral-rich water, thereby depriving those plants from key nutrients. This process occurs as a result of peat accumulation, which increases with the&nbsp;slow rates of decay of mosses (Pastor et al. 2002). Once the ombrotrophic conditions are reached, the competitive ability of sphagnum boosts, increasing their dominance. This in turn contributes to more peat accumulation (Granath et al. 2010). Sphagnum out-competes vascular plants, by getting inputs from the atmosphere and releasing decay-resistant and low-nutrient litter, creating a slow nutrient flux. Particularly relevant is nitrogen immobilization, making vascular plants entirely dependent on the slow mineralization of peat (Pastor et al. 2002; Malmer et al. 2003; Tomassen et al. 2003). Additionally, the low-porosity character of sphagnum peat promotes waterlogged conditions that further reduce mineralization rates (references in Eppinga et al. 2007).&nbsp;Other mechanisms include&nbsp;acidification of the environment, competition for light and space, and belowground temperature lowering. Through the organic acids resulting from its humification, bog sphagnum actively promotes acidification of the environment, which limits vascular plant growth (references in Eppinga et al. 2007). In such sphagnum-dominated sites, the establishment and growth of vascular plants is limited by the thick moss carpet that overgrows seedlings (Ohlson et al. 2001; Malmer et al.2003), and its vertical growth engulfing meristemic tissues (references in Pastor et al 2002). Also, the growing season for vascular plants is shortened, given the poor heat conductivity of sphagnum peat, which hampers the functioning of vascular plant roots (references in Eppinga et al. 2007).</p> <p>Drought or drainage can trigger a shift from Bogs&nbsp;to Fens. A prolonged drought might lower the water table long enough to force moss desiccation and allow for increased mineralization (Tomassen et al. 2003; Eppinga et al. 2009; Granath et al. 2010). This reduces the competitive pressures on vascular plants, increasing the opportunities for colonization. Drainage is a primary shock altering peatland dynamics by lowering the water table (Limpens et al. 2008), and it is done for agricultural and forestry purposes. Also, an influx of water high in nutrients or minerals (e.g. Ca) from surrounding land or from atmosphere could also damage Sphagna and cause vascular plant invasion. Similarly, liming (i.e. spreading Ca- or Mg-rich minerals) is another direct human intervention to eliminate Sphagnum. Basically, as soon as the inorganic nutrient pool that vascular plants require ceases to limited by slow sphagnum peat mineralization rates, this regime shift could occur.</p> <p>Key mechanisms behind the maintenance of Fens&nbsp;are related to peat accumulation and vascular plants. While vascular plants, which can become highly productive under the influence of geogenous water or some other source of important nutrients, minerotrophic conditions seriously prevent bog sphagnum from settling given its high sensitivity to calcareous water (Granath et al. 2010). Advective transport of nutrients has been proposed by Rietkerk et al. (2004) as a scale-dependent mechanism, having a locally positive and long-range negative effect on nutrient concentration, to explain the spatial patterning of peatlands. This mechanism would be driven by transpiration of vascular plants, enhancing drier microforms (hummocks, ridges) with increased nutrient concentration that vascular plants require to establish and further reinforce their presence.&nbsp;Additionally, transpiration rates are higher in the presence of vascular plants, and this stimulates a lowering of the water table&nbsp;(Rietkerk et al. 2004). While this reduction of water in the surface negatively affects sphagnum productivity by desiccation (references in Tomassen et al 2003), it also leads to an increase of mineralization rates, which reinforces the presence of vascular plants (Tomassen et al. 2003). Another competitive mechanism operates as vascular plants reach above the moss carpet, limiting its development through shading and burial by litter (Berendse et al. 2001; Pastor et al. 2002; Malmer et al. 2003). Under these conditions the limited growth of Sphagnum prevents peat accumulation (Malmer et al. 2003; Limpens et al. 2008).&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Shift from Fens to Bogs</strong></p> <p>Increases in precipitation could lead to a higher water table, potentially causing substantial dieback of vascular plants (references in Eppinga et al. 2007). Moreover, the minerotrophic conditions that are detrimental for bog sphagnum growth are reduced as the relative importance of precipitation water increases over that of geogenous water (Pastor et al. 2002). The height of the peatland surface above the water table is a key determinant of plant species distribution and primary productivity, and consequently the rates of litter production and litter decay losses (Hilbert et al. 2000; Belyea &amp; Malmer 2004). Given the explained mechanism of delayed nutrient flux, it is clear that at a certain height of the surface above the water table, bog sphagnum becomes a superior competitor (Granath et al. 2010), and the reinforcing feedbacks of Bogs are activated.</p> <p>It is worth mentioning that even though the literature cited here in reference to these alternate stable states relies deeply on modeling (e.g. Hilbert et al 2000; Pastor et a 2002; Rietkerk et al 2004; Eppinga et al 2007, 2009), qualitatively similar shifts have been reported in paleoecological studies as well as present day observations: dominance of deciduous shrubs and graminoids during the early stages of peatland development with little or no presence of moss, followed by landscapes dominated by Sphagnum lawns after the ombrotrophication process, which are later subjected to invasion by shrubs and spruce (references in Pastor et al 2002). The fact that such abrupt shifts between a near-monoculture moss state and a co-existence with vascular plants state have been reported to occur sometimes but not always, suggests that these systems do exhibit alternate stable states.</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Bogs to Fens</strong></p> <p>Since sphagnum litter enhances the formation of collapsible peat (i.e. with low porosity), which easily becomes waterlogged, the conditions for low rates of decomposition, and an overall net carbon sequestration effect are maintained in Bogs. Rates of carbon sequestration and methane emission depend strongly on height of the peatland surface above the water table (references in Belyea &amp; Malmer 2004). Even though the same processes of anaerobic decomposition that increases carbon accumulation, also increases methane production, the overall desirable effect in relation to climate change gets lost in this shift, since the effect of removing long-lived atmospheric carbon dioxide ultimately surpasses that of releasing short-lived methane (Limpens et al. 2008).</p> <p>Because of the complex relations of acrotelm thickness with vegetation and microtopography, these two are considered to primarily determine carbon sequestration/emission rates (Belyea &amp; Malmer 2004; Belyea &amp; Baird 2006). Peat formation rate is greatest for 'intermediate microforms' (lawns, low hummocks) and lowest for microforms at the extremes of the water table gradient (high hummocks and pools) (Belyea &amp; Malmer 2004). Given this trade-off of decomposability and productivity between elevated and low microforms (reference in Limpens et al 2008), a landscape will exhibit higher short-term sequestration of carbon or long-term storage depending o the microforms by which it is dominated.</p> <p><strong>Shift from Fens to Bogs</strong></p> <p>A reduction in species richness and the loss of agriculturally suitable lands are potential impacts of the shift to sphagnum-dominated peatlands.</p>","<p>Damming or blocking ditches are common management practices aimed at raising the water table.&nbsp; More direct practices to recover or sustain sphagnum vegetation is to establish rafts of floating brush or clumps of peat for floating mosses settle, as well as the creation of suitable microclimates through techniques such as applying a layer of straw mulch, and carving depressions that promote carpet or lawn level Sphagnum (references in Limpens et al. 2008 and in Rydin &amp; Jeglum 2006).</p>","(#1) Belyea LR, Baird AJ. 2006.

It is mainly driven by population growth, housing preferences, demand for social security and aesthetic preferences. The key maintainers of sprawl are road infrastructure designed with automobile use in mind and government's intentional and unintentional support for city expansion. Many cities are beginning to realize the negative impacts of urban sprawl, and governments are working towards shifting from sprawling of cities to development towards a more compact structure. This is made by e.g. investments in public transportation and new compact and mixed used areas where automobiles are not necessary.&nbsp;</p>","Infrastructure development, Environmental shocks (eg floods)",Urban,Planetary,"Soil formation, Primary production, Nutrient cycling, Water cycling",Biodiversity,"Freshwater, Food crops, Livestock, Fisheries, Wild animal and plant products, Timber, Woodfuel, Fuel and fiber crops, Hydropower","Air quality regulation, Climate regulation, Water purification, Water regulation, Regulation of soil erosion, Pollination, Natural hazard regulation","Recreation, Aesthetic values, Knowledge and educational values, Spiritual and religious","Food and nutrition, Health (eg toxins, disease), Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values, Social conflict",,Local/landscape,"Years, Decades","Irreversible (on 100 year time scale), Hysteretic","Models, Contemporary observations","Speculative – Regime shift has been proposed, but little evidence as yet","Contested – Multiple proposed mechanisms, reasonable evidence both for and against different mechanisms",Freshwater Eutrophication,"<p>When discussing the two different regimes we will focus on the archetypes for compact city and sprawled city as large cities and megacities that still attract people. Thus, rather than a proper regime shift, development of cities is often path dependent according to one of the two trajectories towards either a sprawling city or a compact city. Our focus is on urban areas in developed countries, therefore we do not take e.g. poor city slums into consideration.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Compact city</strong></p> <p>A compact city is more than just a city that is densely populated. ''Dwelling density, the advancement of mixed-use development, and reaffirmed focus on the nature and quality of development have been identified as important aspects in the creation of the compact city'' (Arbury 2005).Three elements are consistently found in many literatures that describe a compact city - mix-used development, greater focus on public transportation and quality urban design (Breheny 2001, Arbury 2005). Studies have included the promotion of urban regeneration, the revitalisation of town centres, and restraint on development in rural areas (Breheny 2001) and pedestrian friendly with large pavements (Arbury 2005) as part of the definition.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Sprawling city</strong></p> <p>Urban sprawl can be defined as ''unplanned, uncontrolled, and uncoordinated single use development that does not provide for a functional mix of uses and/or is not functionally related to surrounding land uses and which variously appears as low-density ...development'' (Arbury 2005). The European Environment Agency (EEA) has described sprawl as the physical pattern of low-density expansion of large urban areas, under market conditions, mainly into the surrounding agricultural areas. Low-density, single-use and automobile dependent type of development has been the key attributes with lack of planning and control being the key enablers for urban sprawl. &nbsp;</p> <p>Unfortunately, there is not one single measurement for compact city or sprawling city. It requires a set of indicators that incorporate economic, social and environmental attributes of city development. Furthermore, defining what is desirable is quite subjective to preferences held by residents of different cities, which implies what may be desirable for one city might be undesirable for others.&nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Compact City to Sprawling City</strong></p> <p>The main drivers and causes contributing to sprawl are urban population growth and the demand for housing. City expansion impels economic development, through the production of jobs, creativity, technology and the accumulation of knowledge and economic markets, which in many ways can lead to better welfare (Bairoch 1991). This induces the demand to live more spaciously, own a private lot and drive a car. Moreover, there are many people wishing to live closer to nature, hence people preferring aesthetic quality of the landscape seems to be contributing to sprawl development (Brown 2006). At the same time living in the inner city becomes more and more expensive and undesirable.</p> <p>In Europe, many cities developed long before cars existed, and therefore have a more compact structure. Cities in North America, Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, are planned for automobile use as a central part of the city system. Infrastructure, such as construction of roads, works as a feedback in the system and facilitates transportation. Increased private automobile ownership and low prices of fuel raises the automobile use even further. Another cause is the sudden rush of people to a city due to natural disasters (famines, flooding etc.) leading to uncontrolled sprawled or slum areas. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>","<p>A compact city has a diversity of functions congregated at the same place. It is designed with a mixed-use construction, pedestrian friendly roads and alternative means of transport. Instead of a ''laissez faire'' trend in urban planning, there is usually conscious control of city expansion with urban intensification, investments in public transportation and urban quality design (Arbury 2005). The functions of a compact city are self-reinforcing since its structure promotes public transportation, biking and walking before automobile use, with housing, work and shopping within reasonable distances. However, city expansion without conscious planning usually results in the city sprawling, also in originally compact cities, which explains why many old European cities have a compact core but a sprawled periphery.</p> <p>Thus, almost all cities have elements of both sprawl and compact development, and once an area is built, it is hard to change its structure. Therefore, there are no precise thresholds and there is no regime shift in its proper sense, but rather a path dependency towards either sprawl or compact development. This pattern is described by Scheffer and Carpenter:''For conditions in which alternative equilibriums exist, the initial state (i.e. place in the landscape) determines the equilibrium to which the system will settle''(2003).</p> <p>The regime of a sprawling city refers to low-density development of urban areas with a single use structure. This means the functions of housing, service and work opportunities are separated into different areas in the city. Infrastructure of roads and the automobile use make transport between these areas possible, hence maintaining the system. In countries such as USA, Australia and New Zealand, many cities were constructed after the invention of cars, rendering less dense city centers suited for automobile use. This construction automatically implies a bigger risk of sprawling compared to older European cities. Population growth and demand for housing are the main factors that drive this system.&nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Compact City to Sprawling City&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Sprawl leads to loss of land, which could have a negative impact on all provisioning ecosystem services depending on what type of land that is removed. Examples of such provisioning services are food crops, livestock, fisheries, wild animals, plant products, timber, fuel, fibre crops and woodfuel. This also leads to loss of air quality regulation from trees. Furthermore, there is biodiversity loss affecting other regulating services such as pollination, carbon sequestration, pest control and disease control.&nbsp;Cities in general and the expansion of the cities in particular result in increased emissions of greenhouse gases. Cities emit 70% of the world's greenhouse gases, which have vast consequences for the climate (CDP Cities 2011).</p> <p>Since sprawled areas consist of private owned lots, commercial centres and roads, there is a lack of public space (Arbury 2005). Thus, people who own a private lot gain from sprawl whereas others loose. The suburban residents get the advantages of living in a house, away from urban stress and insecurities, but still have access to work opportunities and activities in the city (Arbury 2005). Also pollution and car accidents have a bigger impact on inner city dwellers since cars gather in the centre (Ewing 2008). Segregation is another problem that increases with sprawl, leading to poorer health among people who are less well off (Arbury 2005).&nbsp;Shifting from a compact to sprawling city affects cultural services such as&nbsp;recreation areas, aesthetic values, knowledge, educational values and spiritual and religious values. The compact city model encourages people to use public transportation and to walk and bike more, which have a positive impact on human health. However, city life is often considered stressful and can contribute to mental strains.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>Governments have an important role to play to ensure that feedback mechanisms enable sprawling cities to develop more&nbsp;effectively. An important first step is to formulate and enforce a city plan with wide public support (EEA 2006). Bold steps can be taken to abolish subsidies and other governmental support on outskirt road construction and ''new town'' developments. Full cost of providing public utilities, i.e. electricity, water and sanitation supply and waste treatment can be incurred to residents in newly developed areas (EEA 2006). Full cost of externalities from private automobile use can also be incurred through tax on vehicle ownership, fuel price and other schemes such as city tolls. Public finance from these resources along with savings from less road construction can be invested to promote inner-city mobility, such as investment on public transportation and bicycle and pedestrian roads.&nbsp;Without city planning, there will always be economic, social and environmental driving forces motivating people to move to the outskirts, as long as there is population growth. However, as long as the government does not allow feedback mechanisms of sprawl to be initiated, such as government support for road construction and large-scale outskirt development, or become too strong, this will be enough to prevent sprawl. This will enhance the resilience of the city to stay compact. &nbsp;</p> <p>However, in order to restore a sprawled city back to a compact city, a comprehensive and balanced approach that fundamentally reverse all drivers and feedbacks are necessary (EEA 2006). Another possible approach will be to establish new feedbacks that lead to compact city structure. Foremost, inner city building structures should be transformed into mixed-use structure so that affordable inner-city housing becomes more accessible. City planners should be on the lookout for ''windows of opportunity'', i.e. brownfield projects, to turn unattractive urban areas into mixed used housing or urban green areas. Governments should work actively to prevent inner-city crime and improve environmental conditions in order to make living in the city more safe and attractive (Ewing 2008). &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","(#1) Arbury, J., 2005.

Meandering and braided rivers are especially vulnerable to such shifts. The actual shift of the channel usually follows a large flood event, but other factors make the system susceptible to the shift. Most commonly, sediment buildup blocks the riverflow due to changes in current and riverbed gradient. In other cases, a cutoff occurs at the meandering neck in rivers with high channel sinuosity. Human activities such as land clearance and artificial channel widening can also make the river system vulnerable to a sudden course change. A shift in river channel position has large impacts on the ecology, economy and society, especially through impacts on water availability which is&nbsp;important for agriculture and transportation. On a 100 year time-scale the shift is irreversible. Only enormous engineering efforts can prevent a river from switching to a new channel, or restore a former river course.

Meandering rivers are especially vulnerable to channel changes because of their high sinuosity which supports meander cutoffs. Other river types with a lower sinuosity can also experience river channel position shifts, for example braided rivers which have many small channels.&nbsp;Changes in river channel position can be understood as regime shifts when one considers the timescale at which they occur and the irreversibility of the shift. Large channel shifts (shifting the river position tens of kilometers) occur only approximately once a millennium. Within this timeframe humans settle along the river and establish complex social and economic structures which depend on the river. When a large, abrupt shift in the channel position occurs it results in huge disruption and the need for large-scale reorganization of the economy and societies that depend on the river. Once the river channel has shifted it will very rarely return to its former position, but instead become stabilized in its new position. In this context the alternate regimes are:</p> <p><strong>Old channel course</strong></p> <p>In this regime the river flows along a path which it has followed for many decades. People have therefore adapted to and have based their activities on this position of the river channel. For example, the floodplain area is often used by farmers to cultivate crops. Cities are located in the floodplain area, often protected by levees in case of a flood event. The mentality of the local inhabitants is that a channel shift should not be allowed to happen because their well-being is closely linked to the river in its current position. Therefore, large defense infrastructure is sometimes a characteristic of this regime (see also Tisza River case study).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>New channel course</strong></p> <p>In this regime the river has switched its main course to a new path, often tens of kilometers from its previous course. Typically, riverflow is more rapid, and the length of the river is shorter. In the case of a meander cutoff, a so-called oxbow lake is formed. This happens when the meandering necks connect with each other and the abandoned part of the river after the cutoff is disconnected from the riverflow. The size of a cutoff and the resulting oxbow lake varies and depends on the size of the river.&nbsp;</p>","<p>The main direct driver of the regime shift is strong floods, associated with large rainfall events. Such events cause the river to shift its course because they have enough power to break through a natural river levee or dyke, and to breach defense infrastructure such as a spillway that tries to control the riverflow (see Mississippi Case Study).</p> <p>Human activities such as artificial channel widening, removal of debris, changes in the river course or cutting of vegetation play an important role in making a river more susceptible to channel shifts. The reason is that people may change the actual channel to improve transport or create a shortcut to decrease travel time and costs. Often, these activities might start very small by (e.g. removal of debris) and then slowly grow (e.g. by digging of a channel to make a shortcut) until a critical threshold has been reached and the river suddenly changes its course. In the case of the Ucayali River in Peru, an inconspicuous ditch of approximately one meter width was slowly but systematically widened which eventually led to a 71 kilometer cutoff after a strong flood event (see Ucayali River case study) with large negative impacts for the people living in the region. The destruction of dykes or levees can also cause a river channel to shift its position. For instance, a dyke at the Yellow River was destroyed to check the advance of the Jin army in China in 1128, leading to a shift in the river's course (see Yellow River Case Study).&nbsp;</p>","<p>Floods are usually the direct cause of a shift in river channel position. However, the interplay of many different drivers is responsible for making a river vulnerable to changes in its course. The most common process is that over time sediment buildup gradually blocks the riverflow. A river always tries to take the shortest path and the steepest gradient due to&nbsp;gravity. When sediment is deposited on the riverbed, the gradient declines and slows down the current. This in turn leads to more deposition of sediment because of lower discharge until the river is blocked and spills to the side. This is a natural process, occurring approximately once a millennium in large rivers such as the Mississippi River (see Mississippi River case study).</p> <p>In other cases, it is common that cutoffs occur at the meandering neck in rivers with high channel sinuosity. Erosion processes and scouring lead to channel incision and erosion of the river walls until the river suddenly breaks through the meandering neck, forming a cutoff. The river is then straightened and a so-called oxbow lake forms. This process is especially pronounced in rivers with a high sediment loading, for example the Amazon River in South America. Cutoffs vary in size depending on the size of the river and can occur alone or consecutively within a short period of time. Such shifts can be linked to the theory of self-organized criticality (SOC). According to SOC, cutoffs occur when the sinuosity of the river meander increases to a critical threshold at which the cutoff occurs.</p> <p>A crevasse splay can also be responsible for a river channel position shift. It occurs when a natural levee, which was formed by sediment loading along the floodplain, suddenly breaks. This process is known as avulsion. This type of river channel position shift is common in river deltas (so-called delta switching) such as the Mississippi River delta or the Yellow River delta. Over a long period of time, a river delta can shift hundreds of kilometers due to repeated shifts in its main river channel and tributaries. Channel cutoffs in river deltas can also lead to the formation of so-called delta lobes through sedimentation which can form superlobes which in turn can cause further channel shifts.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Large rivers are of vital importance for the ecology, the economy and the society. They provide for example freshwater for inhabitants living in the region and are an important economically, for example as transportation routes, for inland navigation, the supply of fresh water,&nbsp;food and nutrition through small-scale and large-scale crop cultivation, fisheries, water regulation and regulation of soil erosion.When a river channel shifts course, local industries, cities and agriculture along the old channel course are therefore severly affected.&nbsp;Economic activities along the old channel will usually decline, and in some cases seaports have to be moved.&nbsp;However, impacts might also be positive, for example a decrease in flood events and flood levels along the old channel course. This may lead to new economic opportunities such as changes in subsistence and cash crops that generate a higher income.&nbsp;However, they may also experience greater threats of flooding. The impacts might also consist of an increase in flood levels, riverbed aggradation, bank erosion, lateral channel shifts and stranded communities. These negative impacts might in turn lead to migration.&nbsp;</p> <p>Large rivers may be very important for regional and global trade. Therefore, a significant change in the position of the main channel usually has significant, mostly negative, impacts on human well-being.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>Typically, river channel position regime shifts are irreversible. Without human action the river will almost never return to its original course. Managing river channel position regime shifts is very difficult because of the sudden and nonlinear nature of such shifts.</p> <p><strong>Options for enhancing resilience</strong></p> <p>In some situations attempts are made to retard or prevent a channel shift by controlling the riverflow (volume, current) through engineering works such as levees, spillways and weirs. This is usually done to protect housing, infrastructure and floodplain agriculture. However, efforts to modify the riverflow or implement defense infrastructure are usually extremely costly and requires enormous engineering efforts. Moreover, it is possible that the point where the shift is predicted to occur moves upstream or downstream, in which case the defense infrastructure becomes useless.&nbsp;The most iconic example of extensive engineering control structures to prevent a channel shift is the Mississippi River. The main channel is threatened by capture by the Atchafalaya River, and if this were to occur, New Orleans and Baton Rouge would suffer enormous negative economic consequences (see Mississippi River case study).</p> <p><strong>Options for reducing resilience to encourage restoration or transformation</strong></p> <p>It is possible to reduce the resilience of the system to encourage it to shift to a new channel position or return to a previous position, for example by removing levees.

This regime shift is primarily driven by the rate of sea level rise and the rate of sediment delivery. Transitions to consumer control either through the overharvesting of predators or the introduction of invasive/ exotic species can also contribute to this regime shift. It has long been recognized that salt marshes have the capacity to regulate their platform elevation in response to rises in the sea level through a series of non-linear biophysical feedback mechanisms. However, thresholds exists in the rate of sea level rise (RSLR) and the rate of sediment delivery, where upon the mechanisms that effectively control the platform elevations are no longer able to keep up with sea level rise. Effective management options largely depend on the regional variables of the system. These options range from the reintroduction of top predators and removal of invasive/ exotic species to coordinated dam releases to provide necessary sediment pulses.&nbsp;</p>","Vegetation conversion and habitat fragmentation, Infrastructure development, Species introduction or removal, Global climate change",Land use impacts are primarily off-site (e.g. dead zones),Marine & coastal,"Soil formation, Primary production, Nutrient cycling",Biodiversity,"Fisheries, Fuel and fiber crops","Climate regulation, Water purification, Regulation of soil erosion, Natural hazard regulation","Recreation, Aesthetic values, Knowledge and educational values","Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values",,Local/landscape,"Years, Decades",Hysteretic,"Models, Paleo-observation, Contemporary observations, Experiments",Contested – Reasonable evidence both for and against the existence of RS,Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism,,"<p>Coastal ecosystems of the intertidal zone located in temperate/ mid-latitudes can shift between a salt marsh and either a tidal flat or subtidal flat. The alternate regimes (tidal flat or subtidal flat) vary regionally based on a number of different factors including tidal basin topography, climate, hydrology, vegetation, and sediment loading. The alternate regimes are:</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Salt Marsh</strong></p> <p>This regime is largely dominated by the growth and presence of Spartina alterniflora (Smooth Cordgrass) along the east coast of North America and Spartina anglica (Common Cordgrass) in continental northern Europe, halophytes adapted to saline and water logged environments (Marani et al. 2010). The high density, largely monoculture systems exist in the intertidal zone, experiencing daily inundation. While generally found between mean sea level and mean high tide, the range of Spartina and the optimum level for the marsh platform varies regionally based on tidal range, nutrient loading, vegetation, sediment loading, and climate (McKee &amp; Patrick 1988; Morris et al. 2002).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Tidal Flat/ Subtidal Flat</strong></p> <p>This regime is void of vegetation. Instead, it is characterized by microbial food chains, dominated by benthic macroorganisms and benthic microalgae (Alongi 1998). Existing below mean sea level (MSL), the surface is only exposed during the lowest tides (Fagherazzi et al. 2006; Defina et al. 2007). On the other hand, subtidal flats are permanently submerged.&nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Salt Marsh to Tidal Flat/ Subtidal Flat</strong></p> <p>One of the main drivers resulting in a shift from a salt marsh to tidal flat/subtidal flat is an increasing rate of sea level rise. The direct impact of climate change on an increasing rate of sea level rise and the resulting impact on marine coastal systems has been well established (UNEP 2006). Broadly speaking, mean global sea level changes through the dual processes of thermal expansion and shifts in the hydrologic budget (amount of water in the oceans vs. other reservoirs &ndash; i.e. atmosphere, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets &amp; terrestrial reservoirs). It has long been recognized that salt marshes have the capacity to regulate their platform elevation in response to rises in the sea level through a series of non-linear biophysical feedback mechanisms (Murray et al. 2008; Kirwan et al. 2010). However, a threshold exists in the rate of sea level rise (RSLR), where upon the mechanisms that effectively control the platform elevations are no longer able to keep up (Kirwan et al. 2010).</p> <p>Another direct driver leading to a shift from a salt marsh to either a tidal flat or subtidal flat is changes in sediment delivery. Changes in the delivery rates have been linked to land use management and change throughout the watershed/ catchment basin (Pasternack et al. 2001; UNEP 2006; Kirwan et al. 2011). Reductions in the delivery rates of sediment from upstream inhibit the rate of soil accretion and the effective response of marsh platform elevation to rising sea level.</p> <p>Furthermore, the tidal flat/ subtidal flat regime can be caused by an increase in consumer control &ndash; i.e. unchecked populations of herbivores (e.g. snails, crabs) govern ecosystem productivity and structure. Such an increase can result from either the overharvesting of predators or through the introduction of invasive and/or exotic species. In addition, it has been suggested that nitrogen loading and the weakening of plant defenses (increased salt stress due to climatic extremes) have also contributed to the shift to consumer control and resulting cascading effects leading to the tidal flat/ subtidal flat regime (Bertness &amp; Silliman 2008).&nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Salt Marsh to Tidal Flat/ Subtidal Flat</strong></p> <p>The salt marsh regime is sustained by a process of soil accretion that maintains the marsh platform elevation above mean sea level under normal rates of sea level rise (Kirwan et al. 2010). The effective maintenance of the marsh platform elevation and the rate of soil accretion are dependent on a variety of mechanisms and biophysical feedback loops. As sea level rises, the amount and frequency of inundation increases. Increased inundation results in an increase in water depth in the salt marsh and in turn a decrease in flow strength. The decreased flow strength results in an increase in sedimentation. This in turn contributes to an increase in vertical accretion and a higher marsh platform elevation. The higher platform elevation then reduces the amount and frequency of inundation ensuring that the marsh does not get flooded and avoiding a die off of the vegetation.</p> <p>An increase in inundation also contributes to the growth of vegetation. This increase in vegetative biomass also contributes to an increase in vertical accretion through biostabilization, wave dampening, sediment trapping, organic deposition, and below ground organic production (Fagherazzi et al. 2006; Kirwan et al. 2011). Vertical accretion, as highlighted above contributes to a higher marsh platform elevation, which in turn reduces the amount of inundation ensuring that the marsh does not get flooded. It is important to note that both processes necessitate an effective sediment supply from upstream in the watershed.</p> <p>However, when the rate of sea level rise increases beyond a certain threshold, or there is a decline in the sedimentation rate or vegetation cover, the salt marsh may shift to a tidal flat. When the rate of sea level rise exceeds the rate of soil accretion, the marsh will become inundated and lead to the drowning and die off of vegetation. The loss of vegetation can lead to further cascading effects through two mechanisms. The first is that the loss of vegetation leads to an increase in erosion of the marsh platform, which further inhibits the growth of vegetation. The second is through a change in soil conditions. The loss of vegetation can result in an increase in soil salinity, which in turn inhibits recolonization and further contributes to the loss of vegetation (Bertness &amp; Silliman 2008).</p> <p>Just as the rate of sea level rise is not a constant, neither is the sediment delivery rate. As a result, key thresholds regarding the RSLR are directly linked to the suspended sediment concentration. As the sediment load decreases due to changes in upstream land use practices and/or the establishment of dams, the rate of soil accretion decreases, and the critical RSLR at which the marsh shifts to a tidal flat will be reduced.</p> <p>The rate of sea level rise and suspended sediment concentration also influence key processes occurring at the margins of the marsh through their influence on the tidal flat water depth which contributes to the expansion/reduction of the marsh platform at the marsh boundary (Mariotti et al. 2010). Two different feedback loops directly impact the water depth on the tidal flat. The Wave Factor [1] at the marsh boundary increases with the tidal flat depth. The increase in the Wave Factor Boundary results in an increase in marsh boundary erosion. Increased erosion increases the sediment supply, which in turn contributes to a decrease in the tidal flat depth (Mariotti et al. 2010). In this manner, it serves as a balancing feedback loop. However, an increase in the tidal flat depth simultaneously contributes to an increased Erosion Factor [2]. This increased EF results in an increase in erosion of the tidal flat, in turn increasing the tidal flat depth. In this manner, it serves as an amplifying feedback loop. Whichever feedback loop is stronger dictates the global character of this process (Mariotti et al. 2010). Thus the RSLR and the suspended sediment concentration contribute directly to these competing feedback loops as both directly influence the tidal flat depth.</p> <p>Once a tidal flat/ subtidal flat is established, it is maintained by the higher rates of erosion associated with the lack of vegetation and the continued inundation, so that bottom elevation remains below mean sea level (Defina et al. 2007). Even if the rate of sea-level rise drops again to previous levels the tidal flat may be maintained by these processes. The critical rate of sea-level rise at which a shift from tidal flat to salt marsh occurs is therefore lower than the threshold at which the shift from salt marsh to tidal flat occurs. However, increased sedimentation due to a pulse in sediment supply, decreased tidal velocities, or protection by new spits and barrier islands may provide conditions for recolonization of Spartina, a rise in the platform level, and an eventual shift to a salt marsh regime (Defina et al. 2007). [1] Mariotti et al. (2010) calculate the Wave Factor at the marsh Boundary by taking into account a number of variables including: wave power, number of marsh boundary elements, boundary length, time, wind speed, wind direction. [2] Mariotti et al. (2010) calculate the Erosion Factor by taking into account a number of variables including: current bottom shear stresses, wave bottom shear stresses, wind direction, wind speed &amp; total area of the tidal flat.&nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Salt Marsh to Tidal Flat/ Subtidal Flat</strong></p> <p>Both salt marshes and tidal flats/ subtidal flats provide significant ecosystem services (UNEP 2006). In many cases, they provide similar services but in slightly different ways. For example, while salt marshes contribute to food through serving as nurseries for certain fish species, tidal flats provide important habitat for certain mollusks and crabs (UNEP 2006). However, it is worth noting that the shift from a salt marsh to either a tidal flat or subtidal flat generates a loss of significant ecosystem services in the form of pollution filtration, storm protection, and fisheries enhancement (Gedan et al. 2009). In addition, the loss of these particular ecosystem services draw attention to the impact on and connection to human wellbeing in the form of livelihoods (decrease in fisheries), health (loss of pollution filtration), and climate change vulnerability (decrease in adaptive capacity and loss of storm protection).&nbsp;</p>","<p>Addressing rates of sea level rise requires an international commitment to addressing climate change. In addition, the time frame for the global climate and in turn RSLR to respond to new policies necessitates a long-term outlook. However, there are a number of management actions or interventions that can be implemented on a more local/regional scale to effectively address issues directly related to sediment delivery rates and the process of consumer control. Mudd (2011) suggest that for those watersheds that have been impounded, scheduled dam releases could be coordinated to supply a sediment pulse to encourage marsh establishment and expansion. Restoration practices that reduce/ remove invasive/exotic species and/or the reestablishment of predator populations could effectively shift the community structure in such a manner that reduces the consumer control and allows for the establishment of a salt marsh (Gedan et al. 2009).</p> <p>Salt marshes exist within a heterogeneous coastal zone that is rapidly becoming human dominated - one third of the human population lives in coastal areas (UNEP 2006). This situation imposes certain constraints that must also be taken into consideration when thinking about the effective management and restoration of salt marshes. The long-term ability of a salt marsh to regulate its height in response to increased rates of sea level rise necessitates the flow of energy and materials into and out of the system. Tidal restrictions due to roads, railroad bridges, and their associated culverts can drastically change the dynamics in the system and have led to shifts in community composition (Gedan et al.&nbsp;2009). A second key issue is the encroachment of development right up to the marsh's upland boundary. Such encroachment does not leave room for the marsh platform to migrate inland as it responds to increased rates of sea level rise. If the full suite of such pressures and drivers operating at various spatial and temporal scales both within and adjacent to the system are not taken into account, the long term resilience of the system may be compromised, and efforts at restoration may be undermined.&nbsp;</p>","(#1) Alongi, D. 1998.

Invasive floating plant species might grow very rapidly and aggressively outside their natural environment with the consequence that they might take over an entire water body by reducing the incidence of light, which in turn lead to a decrease of submerged plants.

The actual shift to boreal forest with spruce and pine as the dominant species is unlikely to occur this century due to time lags involved with species migration. Shrub expansion in the Arctic tundra is the first phase of this regime shift, which is reinforced by carbon release due to permafrost degradation, which in turn increases climate warming and microbial activity enhancing shrub growth.

To date shrub invasion has been the main indicator of a potential regime shift.</p> <p><strong> Arctic tundra regime</strong></p> <p>This regime is characterized by low atmospheric temperatures that enable the formation of a layer of permanently frozen subsoil (permafrost) consisting mostly of gravel and finer material. The ecosystem has a low rate of primary production due to impeded mineral nutrient cycling. The short growing season in summer influences the vegetation and its root systems by limiting vertical expansion. Only plant species (lichens, liverworts, mosses) that are adapted to sweeping winds and soil disturbance can survive in these conditions. The atmospheric cold and existing permafrost restrains the plant growth ensuring that their roots are shallow and surface parts are low growing due to the frozen ground underneath the permafrost. Snow does not accumulate keeping the soil temperature low thus not allowing for permafrost to thaw and release carbon into atmosphere keeping the atmosphere cold.</p> <p><strong>Boreal forest regime </strong></p> <p>This regime is characterized by flora that mostly consists of cold-tolerant evergreen conifers, such as the evergreen spruce (Picea), fir (Abies), and pine (Pinus), and the deciduous larch or tamarack (Larix). Before these species are established in a region, there is an increased canopy of early-successional species such as aspen and paper birch (Frelich et al. 1995). Dwarf shrubs (e.g., <em>Vaccinium uliginosum</em>, <em>Ledum decumbens, Betula nana</em> and <em>Cassiope tetragona</em>) and low shrubs (e.g., <em>Betula glandulosa, Salix glauca</em>) act as pioneers that colonize the tundra before trees are able to establish (CAVM Team 2003). The shift to boreal forest can occur over a long time period varying from several decades to centuries depending on the migration time lag for each species and the occurrence of favorable conditions for seedling establishment.</p>","<p>The main external driver of this regime shift is CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that increase climate warming (IPCC 2007), leading to changes in the composition and abundance of arctic vegetation, animals and soil structure (Olofsson et al. 2009). Anthropogenic activities that elevate atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are generally considered to be the primary cause for this driver. Carbon release from anthropogenic sources is projected to continue and increase during the coming decades (IPCC 2007). This global driver is well established and could be looked as irreversible in the scale of next hundred years.</p>","<p>The tundra regime is maintained by the low atmospheric temperatures that ensure low soil temperature and the existence of permafrost. This determines the lack of microbial activity and scarce nutrient availability therefore ensuring species composition that are only able to exist in such circumstances.</p> <p>A shift from the tundra regime to boreal forest is initiated by the atmospheric warming that is caused by continuing increase of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The atmospheric temperature increases the period of time when microbial activity and thus nutrient availability is sufficient enough for shrubs and boreal forest pioneer species (birch etc.) to withstand the winter conditions.</p> <p>As a result the increasing number of shrubs ensure that snow drifting creates deep drifts that surround and extend downwind from shrub patches. These drifts increase the insulation of the soil below. This insulation elevates the soil temperature thus further allowing microbial activity to continue during the frigid arctic winter. The elevated soil temperatures under the snow lead to permafrost degradation that release carbon trapped in tundra soils, thereby further contributing to climate warming.</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Tundra to Boreal Forest</strong></p> <p>Tundra provides biodiversity for&nbsp;different animal and plant species that characterize tundra ecosystem. The shift from tundra to boreal forest is projected to occur over large geographic areas throughout the tundra zone, with substantial impacts on the landscape and biodiversity (Bonan 1992). Changes in vegetation are also likely to affect composition of foraging mammals and birds (Hinzman et al. 2005). In addition to modifying wildlife habitat, increased woody shrub abundance will make traversing tundra more difficult for caribou, subsistence hunters and communities that rely on caribou for food, as well as hikers. Herbivores such as reindeers and microtine rodents can also be influenced by the shift towards woody vegetation as they prefer lichens, dwarf shrubs graminoids and deciduous shrubs over tall woody shrubs (Sturm et al. 2005). Increased expansion of woody vegetation may therefore result in tundra species extinctions or radical decrease in numbers. The loss of the climate regulating ecosystem service is a major concern as permafrost thawing is reducing the carbon sink service.</p> <p>For local populations the tundra provides traditional recreation opportunities and contains their knowledge and educational as well as spiritual and religious values, which would be lost with the regime shift.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Shift from Boreal Forest to Tundra&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The change in biodiversity could provide new ecosystem services such as timber production and different wild animals and plant foods. This would benefit loggers as they would increase their income from tree cutting and local communities from goods that come from forest.</p>","<p>In order to prevent or reverse this regime shift it is essential that the input of carbon to the atmosphere is reduced in order to prevent further climate warming. The suggestion of a planetary boundary of 350 ppm for CO<sub>2</sub> levels is a first step in this direction (Rockstrom et al. 2009). Increased understanding of the influence of climate change on the complexity of arctic systems is essential for informing the adaptation of social, economic, and cultural systems to the changes taking place in the Arctic (Hinzman et al. 2005). Technology transfer could be a good initiative from developed countries as they can provide more advanced technological solutions to developing countries to help accelerate the learning curve on GHG emissions. A global response particularly from developed nations that are using the majority of the world's resources on a per capita basis should be in place to deal with such complex systems. Nevertheless, discussions about desirable management strategies and outcomes will be essential as there will be stakeholders who stand to lose from this regime shift (e.g. caribou herders) while others may see the change as desirable and beneficial (e.g. timber production, game hunting).</p>","(#1) Bonan GB, Pollard D, and Thompson SL. 1992.

Several feedbacks play an important role in this regime shift including albedo effects, evapotranspiration and cloud formation, fragmentation and fire-prone area expansion, change in ocean circulation and self organizing vegetation patterns.

Tropical forest includes moist and dry forests (MA, 2005). A mature tropical forest contain at least four layers: emergent layer up to 45 - 80 meters tall, the canopy among 35 - 45 meters tall, the understory layer and the floor layer. Such structure gives a variety of habitats that host roughly half of the known plants and animals biodiversity (MA, 2005). <br /><br /><br /><strong>Savanna regime</strong><br />Savannas, on the other hand, are drylands dominated by a mixture of grasslands and shrublands. The canopy in savannas never closes, and the floor layer is dominated by grasses, especially C4 species. Savannas, dry forest and shrublands conform 40% of the world&rsquo;s land area and host up to 42% of human population (Reynolds et al. 2007, Falkenmark and Rockstr&ouml;m 2008). About 25% of drylands, including savannas, are covered by croplands and sustain 50% of world&rsquo;s livestock (MA, 2005). <br /><br /></p>","<p><strong>Shift from forests to savannas</strong></p> <p>The most widely recognized driver is deforestation and consequently fragmentation of forest landscape, which reduces rainfall and increases surface temperature (Da Silva et al. 2008, Nobre et al. 2009). Reduction of forest cover accelerates albedo effect, loss of evapotranspiration and roughness length (Sternberg 2001), activates fire feedback, changes ocean circulation and warms up sea surface in the Amazon case, and ultimately changes the spatial vegetation structure.<br /><br />Deforestation and forest degradation is driven by a complex, case specific interaction of social and economic drivers. The most important reported drivers include&nbsp;agriculture expansion, infrastructure development, the logging industry and fast population growth (Geist and Lambin 2002, MA, 2005). For example, in the Amazon, illegal logging is a critical threat that besides its damage to the forest, bring with them secondary effects like expansion of hunting areas, slash-and-burn farms, mining, the establishment of new road networks and therefore more logging facilities. The MA (2005) reports that 70 countries have problems with illegal logging leading to national income losses of $5 billions and total economic losses of about $10 billion. By 2001, Laurance and Williamson (2001) reported that 80% of brazilian logging activity were illegal; however, government counterintuitively sponsored colonization through cattle ranching projects. <br /><br />Climate change and global warming are expected to enhance the regime shift; and the loss of forest areas are expected to exacerbate climate change (Laurance and Williamson 2001, Bonan 2008). While Laurance and Williamson (2001) report that forests like Amazon apparently change from carbon sinks to carbon sources during ENSO events; Nobre et al. (2009) suggest that deforestation of Amazon may actually increase ENSO variability; and Bonan (2008) confirms that deforestation would enhance global warming by decrease of evaporative cooling and release of carbon dioxide.</p>","<p><strong>Shift from forest to savanna</strong></p> <p>The expansion of agriculture, increase in population as well as deforestation reduces rainfall and increases surface air temperature. This has a direct affect on plants, reducing evapotranspiration and photosynthesis and decreasing the supply of water vapour. Cattle pastures and regrowth forest areas become increasingly prone to frequent fires, which plays&nbsp;a fundamental role in the shift from forest to savanna since it is a feedback that actually maintains savanna state.</p> <p>When tropical forests are replaced by less vegetated cover like savannas, or ultimately by sand in deserts, net radiation at the top of the atmosphere decreases inducing subsidence that inhibits precipitation (Oyama and Nobre 2004). While in the tropics land clearing affects the water balance and as consequence warms up the climate, in boreal forest such clearing affects mainly albedo and as results cools down climate (Foley et al. 2005). The albedo feedback is strengthened by changes in land cover, typically induced by deforestation for logging or agriculture activities.&nbsp;Warmer temperature and drier atmospheres, such as in savanna regime, result in an increase in lifting condensation level feedback that reduces the opportunity of cloud formation and therefore the likelihood of rainfalls (Pinto et al. 2009). Plants that do not have enough water responds by reducing transpiration and photosynthesis, interrupting the supply of water vapor that contribute to the recycled component of precipitation (Oyama and Nobre 2004, Saleska et al. 2007). Less evapotranspiration blocks the inland propagation of cold fronts responsible for precipitation, increasing the dry season length (Oyama and Nobre 2003, Pinto et al. 2009).</p> <p>Savanna vegetation is better adapted to dry environments. Grasses usually have C4 photosynthesis type, a chemical pathway that reduces water consumption and helps to cope with nitrogen or CO2 limitations. Evapotranspiration depends on soil moisture and biomass. Thus, for instance, droughts frequency or grazing reduce biomass, weakening in turn the feedback effect (Dekker et al. 2007, Dekker et al. 2010). In addition, the spatial distribution of rainfall is affected by both the land-cover type and topography.&nbsp;Cattle pastures and regrowth forest areas become increasingly prone to frequent fires. In such zones fire can be produced after few days of dry conditions. On the regional scale, fire smoke may reduce rainfall by trapping moisture and inhibiting raindrops formation (Laurance and Williamson 2001). Fire plays a fundamental role in the shift from forest to savanna since it is a feedback that actually maintain savanna state (Laurance and Williamson 2001, Hutyra et al. 2005)</p>","<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Forest provides a wide range of ecosystem services. Besides being hot spots of biodiversity, forest provides soil and water protection, it prevents soil erosion, floods and landslides. For example, soil erosion may be 10-20 times higher on areas cleared of forest (MA, 2005). Depending on soil conditions, at the local scale forest can also regulate the hydrological cycles by increasing precipitation and decreasing evaporation. They regulate below grown runoff and smoothing seasonal extreme events: heavy rainfalls or dry spells. Due to its regulating function in the water cycle, forested watersheds provides water supply to one third of the world&rsquo;s largest cities (MA, 2005).&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Forest sustain about 200 million people belonging to indigenous groups, who depend on forest not only as source of resources (food, fiber, fuel) but also their culture and religious traditions (MA, 2005). Forest also maintain the agroforestry industry which, including temperate forests, produces 3.3 billion cubic meters of wood (MA, 2005).&nbsp;</p>","<p>Managerial options for the forest to savanna regime shifts requires targeting the&nbsp;main drivers: deforestation and landscape fragmentation. Controlling illegal logging and implementing sustainable logging plans are part of the strategy. Sustainable logging needs to take into consideration reducing fragmentation and allowing deforested patches to regrow. Likewise, the expansion of agricultural frontier and grazing areas needs to be controlled and when unavoidable, it needs to be planned in order to prevent fragmentation. The fire frequency feedback accelerates the shift from forest to savanna regime. Laurance and Williamson (2001) suggest fundamental changes in prevailing land-use practices and development policies to avoid wildfires. Such changes include the management of logging and grazing areas in order to reduce fragmentation and therefore it would reduce the fire risk. Hence, fire and fragmentation management need to be coupled strategies.</p>","(#1) Bonan, G. 2008. Forests and climate change: Forcings, feedbacks, and the climate benefits of forests.

This regime shift leads to loss of habitat and ecological complexity. Shifts to turf algae are related to nutrient input, while shifts to urchin barrens are related to trophic-level changes. The consequent loss of habitat complexity may affect commercially important fisheries.

This group of species forms submarine forest with three or four layers, which provides different habitats to several species. Kelp ecosystems are important to maintaining important industries such as, lobster and rockfish fisheries, tourism based on fishing, recreational diving and kayaking, as well food and pharmaceutical products derived from kelp (e.g. tooth paste).</p> <p>Three different self-reinforcing regimes can be identified:</p> <p><strong>Kelp forests</strong> are highly productive ecosystems dominated by canopy-formed algae in cold-water rocky marine coastlines. Among the biota associated with kelp forest are marine mammals, fishes, crabs, sea urchins, mollusks, other algae and biota that live on the kelp themselves (Steneck et al. 2002). At least 4 trophic levels are found in kelp forests. Apex predators such as sea otters, cod, pollock, hake, and haddock are common. These predators regulate populations of species at lower trophic levels. In particular the regulation of sea urchins populations, who are an important consumer of kelp, is important to maintain kelp forests.</p> <p><strong> Urchin barrens</strong> are an alternative regime in which there is no kelp forest and substantial populations of urchins on the sea bed. This regime has low or no populations of apex predators and large populations of herbivores that keep macroalgae at very low population levels, preventing the regrowth of the kelp forest, an important habitat for apex predators (Steneck et al. 2004). Ecosystem services related to apex predator fisheries and recreational activities are substantially reduced. However populations of bottom dwelling species can increase. In some places urchins have themselves become a valuable fishery. While in others, populations of other harvested species such as lobster and crab have increased.</p> <p><strong>Turf-forming algae</strong> regime is similar to urchin barrens in that there is no kelp forest, however rather than dominance by urchins the seabed is dominated by turf forming algae. This regime also lacks apex predators (Gorman et al. 2009). Ecosystem services related to fisheries and recreational activities are substantially reduced. However, populations of invertebrate species such as lobster and crab can be higher. This regime shift is associated with a change in habitat in shallow marine coastal ecosystems.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>","<p>This regime shift is driven by two key direct drivers: reducing populations functional groups (Steneck et al. 2002; Steneck et al. 2004) and input of nutrients (Gorman and Connell 2009). Reductions in populations of key functional groups is due to the hunting of sea otter and the fishing of large apex predator fish species. Overfishing usually diminish the controlling function of top predators, and in severe cases, the trophic levels may be simplified. Nutrient input is often due to the output of wastewater from urban settlement and agriculture in nearby coastal areas. However it can also be due to naturally occurring offshore upwelling events. Nutrients favors the growth of turf algae over kelp. Strong rain events and floods can produce shock events for kelp ecosystems by providing a pulse input of nutrients and turbidity, which can stimulate the growth of turf algae.</p> <p>Other drivers can also contribute to this regime shift. Pollution discharges and sedimentation may play a synergetic role as stressors. In Tasmania for example, global warming has favored the reproduction of urchins which acting in synergy with lobster fishing has reduced kelp resilience (Ling et al. 2009). El Ni&ntilde;o events and global warming can generate water stratification. As a consequence, nitrogen concentration declines and kelp forest growth becomes limited by the availability of nitrogen (Steneck et al. 2002).</p>","<p>Shifts from kelp canopies to other regimes like urchin barrens and turfed landscapes have occurred in many regions worldwide (Steneck et al. 2002; Gorman and Connell 2009; Ling, et al. 2009). This regime shift is associated with a change in the biophysical structure in shallow marine coastal ecosystems. Kelp forest dynamics often include cycles of disturbance-recovery. However, increasing human-dominated coastlines modify environmental conditions that facilitate other regimes like turfs or urchin barrens, which in turn inhibits the reestablishment of kelp forests.</p> <p>Overfishing and the input of nutrients are the main drivers of the regime shift. At least 4 trophic levels are found in kelp forests, and apex predators such as sea otters, cod, pollock, hake, and haddock are common. Overfishing usually diminish the controlling function of top predators, and in severe cases, the trophic levels may be simplified. In addition, urchins are prevented from grazing in the kelp forest through the effect of kelp foliage sweeping over the rocks due to its flexibility and the force of waves (Steneck et al. 2004).&nbsp;</p> <p>Overharvesting of sea otter, cod and haddock can release their prey populations in particular sea urchins from their predatory controls (Steneck et al. 2002; Steneck, et al. 2004). Large populations of urchins form grazing fronts that graze on kelp forest to its elimination (Lauzon-Guay et al. 2009). These populations of urchins can survive in adverse conditions by feeding on turf-forming algae.&nbsp;In some cases the removal of apex predators allows populations of other species to reach sufficient population sizes to exert some control on urchins, for example lobsters and crabs in the North Atlantic (Steneck et al. 2002). Therefore, in some cases the formation of urchin barrens open the opportunity for new fishing industry to establish, like urchin, lobster and crabs. In addition, declines in predatory fish have created a market for urchins, especially in Japan, establishing a new human induced control on the herbivore. In some cases, harvesting of urchins for this market has led to the re-establishment of kelp forest, despite urchin fishery being prohibited (Steneck et al. 2002; Scheffer 2009).</p> <p>On the other hand, the turf-forming algae regime is maintained by its ability to persist under conditions of elevated nutrients, frequently attributed to coastal urban settlements, inhibiting the recruitment of kelp species (Gorman and Connell 2009).&nbsp;The loss of kelp dominated areas undermine kelp's ability to reestablish in disturbed areas (Gorman and Connell 2009). While deforested areas surrounded by kelp patches are more likely to return to the kelp regime, isolated kelp disturbed patches are more likely to stick in the turfed regime.</p>","<p><strong>Shift from kelps forest to urchin barrens or turfs</strong></p> <p>The main ecosystem impact of the loss of kelp forests is the loss of habitat complexity. Kelp is a three-dimensional structure that offers shelter and food for many species; urchin barrens and turfs do not have such characteristics. This loss is associated with the reduction of the food web complexity and loss of functional groups (Steneck et al. 2004), with varying effects on fisheries. Some valuable fish species may diminish since kelp forests provide nursery areas. Invertebrate species such as lobster and crab can increases in population (Steneck et al. 2002). Along with hosting high marine biodiversity, kelp forests provide ecosystem services related to recreation for divers. In addition, kelp supports a multi-million dollar industry of canopy-cropping for alginates (Steneck et al. 2002). This product is commercially important in pharmaceutical and chemical industry. These services can be reduced or lost by this regime shift.</p> <p>The ecosystem service impacts of algae turfs are likely to be similar to those related to coastal eutrophication. Such effects include abundance of rich-nutrient environment species as shellfish, bad odors and the associated consequences for recreational and aesthetic values.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Shift from urchin barrens or turfs back to kelp forest.</strong></p> <p>The recovery of kelp forest increases habitat complexity and is expected to increase biodiversity. On the other hand, the benefits gained by urchin and lobster fisheries may be diminished, since the recovery of functional groups and increasing biodiversity will control their populations. However, other species of commercial fisheries and tourism may recover, although it is not always the case.</p>","<p><strong>Options for enhancing resilience</strong></p> <p>Restoring biodiversity in functional groups in kelp forests is particularly important to maintain apex predators (Estes et al. 2011). A high profile version of this strategy has been implemented to recover sea otter populations on the west coast of North America, by protecting sea otter populations (Steneck et al. 2002).&nbsp;Reducing nutrient runoff from agricultural areas is essential for enhancing resilience, as well as improving water treatment and managing runoff in urban areas (Gorman et al. 2009). The removal of sea&nbsp;urchins along with implementing measures to maintain the abundance of predators like cod, sea otters and sheep-head through fishery controls may provide stability to kelp forest ecosystems (Steneck et al. 2002; Steneck et al. 2004).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Options for reducing resilience to encourage restoration or transformation</strong></p> <p>Transplantation of kelp-forming species has been proposed as a restoration strategy in highly fragmented seascapes. This strategy is likely to increase the supply of kelp propagules to colonize new areas and maintain free substratum for canopy recruitment (Gorman and Connell 2009). However this strategy has not been tested.</p>","(#1) Bakun, A., et al. (2010) Greenhouse gas, upwelling-favorable winds, and the future of coastal ocean upwelling ecosystems.

When bivalve abundance changes, it can have substantial ecosystem impacts, creating two different, self-reinforcing regimes.</p> <p><strong>Bivalve mollusk reef regime</strong></p> <p>When aquatic ecosystems have high bivalve mollusk density, they form reefs that include many bivalves and are shallow, nearing the water's surface. The filtering activity of the bivalves results in clear water with high levels of dissolved oxygen. Plankton populations are limited in these conditions. The bivalves themselves operate as reinforcing feedbacks in that their abundance ensures sufficient filtration to maintain this clear water regime. The clear water in turn reinforces bivalve abundance by maintaining hydrodynamics that are conducive to bivalve health (Scheffer 2009). Large, shallow bivalve mollusk reefs encourage biodiversity by providing habitat and filtering nutrients.</p> <p><strong>Isolated, low density bivalve mollusk regime</strong></p> <p>When aquatic ecosystems have low bivalve mollusk density, the reefs are small and deep. Water is turbid, with low levels of dissolved oxygen. Plankton and filamentous algae flourish under these conditions. Poor reef size and water filtration limit biodiversity. The low bivalve abundance state is reinforced as bivalve health and fecundity is weakened by turbid water conditions. The turbid water conditions are in turn reinforced by low bivalve abundance(Weijerman et al. 2005, Powell et al. 2008).</p> <p>The regime of low bivalve abundance is expected to reduce fish populations, water cleansing and the ability of the ecosystem to maintain biodiversity. Such effects would have an impact on fisheries, human health, and recreation.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Mechanized anthropogenic over-harvesting of bivalve mollusks is the main driver of the shift from high to low abundance (Thrush and Dayton 2002).&nbsp; High inputs of nutrients from agricultural or urban sources can act as a slow driver that weakens bivalve health by creating plankton blooms that the bivalves are unable to filter.&nbsp; Plankton blooms can further weaken the health of bivalves by producing organic matter, whose decay, reduces oxygen availability.&nbsp; A disturbance that can trigger a regime shift is bivalve disease (Powell et al. 2008).&nbsp; When populations are weakened by eutrophication and anoxia, they become physiologically susceptible to diseases that can rapidly devastate remaining populations (Leniham 1999).&nbsp;</p>","<p>Bivalves are a class of mollusks containing over 30,000 species which include scallops, clams, oysters, and mussels. Bivalve mollusks, like corals, are often referred to as ''ecosystem engineers'' because they engineer the physical and hydrodynamic structures of the ecosystems they occupy in a way that produces conditions that support their own population growth. Bivalves live on the sediment surface, where they form reefs that provide increased surface area and habitat for a variety of species. They filter nutrients from the pelagic zone and transfer it to the benthic zone, maintaining the system in a clear water state. If bivalves are not able to maintain clear water, due to declines in bivalve populations or increases in low water quality, the ecosystem can shift to a turbid water state. The main drivers of this shift is direct anthropogenic over-harvesting of the bivalves, followed by a gradual increase of nutrients discharge from agricultural activities and coastal urban settlements.&nbsp; Once mollusk abundance is reduced, plankton and filamentous algae populations can substantially increase. As result, oxygen and light available in the water column is reduced, while nutrients levels accumulate due to the lack of filtration.&nbsp; These processes produce conditions which favour algae over bivalves.&nbsp; If nutrient inputs are substantial, eutrophication and areas of hypoxia (low oxygen) are likely to appear in areas dominated by plankton instead of mollusks.&nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Shift from high to low bivalve mollusk abundance regime</strong></p> <p>The loss of abundant bivalve mollusk reefs threatens diverse ecosystem services. The most direct impact is the loss of valuable shellfisheries. A secondary, but potentially substantial impact is the loss of the filtering service provided by bivalves.&nbsp; In urbanized estuaries, it can necessitate the installation of costly synthetic water filtration technology (Gren et al. 2009).&nbsp; In other areas it can lead to declines in water quality that shift populations and reduce recreation opportunities, and potentially the value of waterfront property.</p> <p>The loss of bivalve habitat structure leads to lower species abundances, and to declines in species richness (Airoldi et al. 2008). Both structural and functional biodiversity is threatened by loss of bivalve abundance, with far reaching effects on marine ecosystems and human ability to exploit such systems (Worm et al. 2006).&nbsp; The regime of low bivalve abundance is expected to reduce fisheries, water cleansing and the ability of the ecosystem to maintain biodiversity. Such effects would have an impact on fishing productivity and human health.</p> <p>The loss of bivalve nutrient filtration can lead to other regime shifts, such as eutrophication and hypoxia, which can produce unproductive and undesirable ecosystems (see Hypoxia and Eutrophication regime shifts).&nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Options for enhancing resilience</strong></p> <p>Estuaries are the world's most degraded marine ecosystems, receiving land-based pollution from crop cultivation and urbanization, and suffering from anthropogenic over-harvesting (Lotze et al. 2006).&nbsp; The resulting problems are complex, impacting bivalve health and fecundity as well as many other species, with far reaching implications in both biological and social domains.</p> <p>Experience has shown that management focused on one species or problem tends to be ineffective.&nbsp; Newer research stresses the need to address natural resources as part of complex social-ecological systems, often with long histories of human exploitation (Jackson et al. 2001). &nbsp; Rather than addressing problems on a species-by-species basis, multi -species management has shown to have synergistic effects.&nbsp; For example, in Chesapeake bay, fisheries management looks at oyster, blue crab, striped bass and shad together (Boesch 2004).</p> <p>Taking this approach further, Ecosystem-based fishery management efforts focus on recognizing interactions between multiple species and environmental stressors, such as low dissolved oxygen levels. Success is measured by the degree to which management efforts include ecosystem-based approaches, rather than by an assessment of fishing stocks (Lotze et al. 2006).&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Options for reducing resilience to encourage restoration or transformation</strong></p> <p>The main option exercised for preventing or reversing a regime shift regarding bivalve abundance is to import bivalve mollusks from another region for aquaculture (Van de Koppel 2008) .&nbsp; Another practice commonly used is to hang bivalves from the surface or build artificial reefs to elevate bivalves in order to avoid the hypoxic conditions in deeper water (Carlsson et al. 2009).&nbsp;</p>","(#1) Airoldi, L., Balata, B.

Encroachment typically occurs when savanna landscapes formerly under wild herbivores or nomadic pastoralism are converted to commercial cattle ranching, involving fencing, water provision for livestock, a fixed (sometimes high) stocking rate, and intentional or unintentional grass fire suppression. Encroachment reduces the grass productivity and can make access by cattle difficult, with substantial negative economic impacts on ranchers. Woody encroachment is usually very difficult and costly to reverse. Managerial recommendations therefore focus on avoidance through moderate grazing and fires of sufficient intensity and frequency to prevent the recruitment of young trees.&nbsp;</p>","Harvest and resource consumption, Species introduction or removal, Environmental shocks (eg floods)","Extensive livestock production (rangelands), Conservation, Tourism","Drylands & deserts, Grasslands","Primary production, Nutrient cycling",Biodiversity,"Livestock, Wild animal and plant products, Woodfuel",Climate regulation,,"Food and nutrition, Livelihoods and economic activity",,Local/landscape,"Years, Decades",Hysteretic,"Models, Paleo-observation, Contemporary observations, Experiments",Contested – Reasonable evidence both for and against the existence of RS,"Contested – Multiple proposed mechanisms, reasonable evidence both for and against different mechanisms","Forest to Savannas, Desertification","<p>Savannas are systems that consist of a mixture of woody vegetation (trees or shrubs) and grasses.&nbsp;Savannas, dry forest and shrublands cover 40% of the world's land area, host up to 42% of the world's human population (Reynolds et al. 2007, Falkenmark and Rockstr&ouml;m 2008), and together with drylands sustain 50% of the world's livestock (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005).</p> <p>At small scales (up to about 10 km<sup>2</sup>) savanna systems, especially those used for extensive cattle ranching, may stabilize in two different self-reinforcing regimes (Walker 1993, Scheffer et al. 2001, Scholes 2003): &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Open, grassy savanna regime</strong></p> <p>In this regime the landscape has a productive grass layer with few mature trees. The canopy in savannas never closes, and the floor layer is dominated by grass, especially C4 species. Most young trees&nbsp;are unable to establish because, while often numerous, seedlings are constantly knocked back to ground level by herbivory and fire. There is enough grass after grazing to support a fire with flame-length taller than the young saplings sufficiently often to keep them in a 'fire trap' (Dublin et al. 1990, Roques et al. 2001b, a). Open savanna systems are suitable for ranching, and are maintained by fire dynamics and grazing.</p> <p><strong>Closed, woody savanna regime</strong></p> <p>In this regime the landscape is dominated by woody shrubs or trees. Once established, woody vegetation is stable because adult trees are seldom killed by herbivory or fire. These alternate regimes can occur at a range of spatial scales. Sometimes larger areas (e.g. an entire cattle ranch) may shift from a grass-dominated to a persistent woody-dominated state (Dublin et al. 1990, Walker 1993). In other cases, the alternate regimes are expressed as a mosaic of small patches of trees or bush interspersed with patches of grass, where the respective patches are highly persistent over time (Rietkerk et al. 2004).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>","<p>Bush encroachment refers to a shift from a grassy system to a persistently woody system. It typically occurs in areas used for free-range cattle ranching, and is usually caused by a combination of grazing and fire management practices.&nbsp;Bush encroachment involves a change in the outcome of the competitive interaction between woody vegetation (shrubs and trees) and herbaceous vegetation (grasses and herbs), mediated by nutrients, grazing, fire, rainfall variability and use of either the woody or grassy components by humans (Anderies et al. 2002, Janssen et al. 2004, Wiegand et al. 2006).&nbsp;The encroachment typically occurs in episodes rather than continuously, and involves a particular set of encroaching species rather than the entire woody community.</p> <p>Bush encroachment typically occurs in areas used for commercial cattle ranching&nbsp;(as opposed to subsistence, communal, or nomadic) and may follow episodes of sustained severe overgrazing, though not necessarily so. It may also occur under other land uses (Wiegand et al. 2006). It tends to be an episodic phenomenon, where the tree cohorts can often be linked to issues in the ranching enterprise &ndash; such as drought-induced debt or downturns in the cattle price cycle (Scholes 2003, Wiegand et al. 2006).&nbsp;</p>","<p>There are several different hypotheses regarding the mechanism by which bush encroachment occurs. Different mechanisms (or combinations of mechanisms) may be important in different places.&nbsp;One proposed mechanism is based on changes in fire regime: in the sustained presence of high numbers of grazers (typically cattle) accumulation of grass fuel is reduced, leading to period without intense fire long enough for woody plants to grow beyond the fire-susceptible stage, which in turn suppresses grass production and fires, further enhancing the establishment of woody vegetation (Higgins et al. 2000, Staver et al. 2009, Staver et al. 2011).&nbsp;A related hypothesis notes the elimination of browsers (especially very large browsers such as elephant and giraffe, but also the more-numerous small browsers) from the system when cattle are introduced (Dublin et al. 1990).&nbsp;Similarly, alien species, such as Prosopis in South Africa or Acacia nilotica in Australia, both deliberately introduced, can play an important role in bush encroachment by affecting fire regimes (Poynton 1990).&nbsp;Another hypothesis focuses on changes in water availability based on the rooting depths of plants: grasses are thought to be more shallowly-rooted than trees, so if grass cover is reduced by overgrazing, this is more water available for trees, which promotes their growth and establishment, further suppressing grass growth (Noy-Meir 1982).&nbsp;Refinements of these hypotheses emphasize combinations of events, such as a multiyear drought or fireless period providing a ''window'' for the establishment of trees (Wiegand et al. 2006).</p> <p>Yet other hypotheses focus on the role that increases in global CO2 levels may play in the observed proliferation of woody plants in many, widely-separated areas of the world during the 20th century. The underlying mechanism is still debated, but several possibilities have been proposed: i) that rising CO2 levels favour C3 (woody plant) photosynthesis relative to C4 (tropical grass) photosynthesis&nbsp; ii) elevated CO2 may reduce transpiration of grasses, leading to greater water percolation and therefore favoring deeper rooted woody species, iii) faster growth of woody plants due to CO2 enrichment, and therefore faster escape of seedlings from susceptibility to fire, iv) investments in carbon-based defense compounds such as tannins, which are the main defense compounds in many encroaching trees but not in grasses (Midgley and Bond 2001, Wiegand et al. 2006).&nbsp;It is striking that encroachment is almost unheard of on communal land, and is not universal on commercial farms. A suggested explanation for this is that communal lands use the trees for firewood and run goats along with cattle, inhibiting the establishment of trees (Scholes 2003). Bush encroachment has been documented in East and Southern Africa (but not West Africa), South America (Uruguay/Argentina and Chile), North America (Texas, New Mexico) and Australia, but not in India, also a savanna environment. Furthermore, it did not happen simultaneously in those places, but 30-50 years after the widespread establishment of sedentary grazing management, what has been referred to as 'commercial' ranching above. This tends to disfavor the rising CO2 hypothesis, although rising CO2 may predispose the shift (Midgley and Bond 2001). &nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Shift from grassy to woody savanna </strong></p> <p>Woody encroachment brings a relatively rapid change, over a decade or two, from a highly productive grass layer to a sparse and unproductive grass component. Since cattle are grass-eaters, this change substantially reduces cattle productivity (Anderies et al. 2002, Scholes 2003), with major impacts on cattle ranchers.&nbsp;On the other hand, encroachment increases the supply of tree-based ecosystem services, such as wood for fuel, charcoal-making and building material. This is somewhat dependent on the species involved. The increase in woody cover could potentially also have macro and micro-climatic effects through impacts on albedo and CO2 uptake, in addition to the decrease in methane emissions from cattle.</p> <p>Difficulties in mustering the cattle in dense bush are a contributing factor. Therefore, wood encroachment leads to economic losses for cattle ranchers in what is frequently an economically marginal area for other agricultural uses such as croplands.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Options for enhancing resilience</strong></p> <p>There is some agreement among researchers and extension workers that encroachment can be avoided by stocking lightly and burning frequently to prevent the establishment of trees and maintain grass crowns - the productive part of the grass that is less affected by fires (Roques et al. 2001b, Janssen et al. 2004). However, this is seldom reflected in management practice.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Options for reducing resilience to encourage restoration or transformation</strong></p> <p>Bush encroachment is expensive to reverse, since rapid results rely on arboricides or repeated mechanical or manual clearing.&nbsp;A common method involves the manual removal of woody vegetation, with repeated follow-up control and the use of fire to enhance the establishment and competitive advantage of grasses (Scholes 1985, 2003).&nbsp;Attempts to reverse bush encroachment often have poor results, either due to the rapid resprouting of the trees or the conversion of the grass layer to less desirable species in the process.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are anecdotal reports of widespread mortality of near-dominant encroaching species after several decades, possibly related to disease, prolonged drought or simply old age, which provides windows for grass establishment and fuel load for intense fires.</p>","(#1) Anderies, J.M.; Janssen, M.A; ans Walker, B. 2002.

Different self-reinforcing regimes can be identified as normoxia, hypoxia and anoxia. Hypoxia is typically associated with eutrophication, and related to excess nutrient inputs from fertilizers or untreated sewage. As a result, hypoxic environments are also know as dead zones, areas where fish and crustaceans are not able to live. Anoxia occurs when hypoxia is exacerbated by releasing hydrogen sulfide, then changing water acidity (pH). Management options include the reduction of nutrient inputs (nitrogen and phosphorous), i.e. by closing the nutrient cycle in agricultural systems and through waste-water treatment.&nbsp;</p>","External inputs (eg fertilizers), Global climate change",Land use impacts are primarily off-site (e.g. dead zones),"Marine & coastal, Freshwater lakes & rivers","Primary production, Nutrient cycling",Biodiversity,"Fisheries, Wild animal and plant products",Water purification,Recreation,"Food and nutrition, Health (eg toxins, disease), Livelihoods and economic activity",,"Local/landscape, Sub-continental/regional","Months, Years, Decades","Hysteretic, Readily reversible","Models, Paleo-observation, Contemporary observations",Well established – Wide agreement in the literature that the RS exists,Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism,"Freshwater Eutrophication, Fisheries Collapse, Marine food webs","<p>The hypoxia regime shift involves a radical change in oxygen concentration in aquatic ecosystems such as rivers, lakes and marine ecosystems. The severity and persistence of hypoxic conditions varies. Episodic oxygen depletion represents 17% of known hypoxia cases, and occurs infrequently with several years sometimes elapsing between events. Episodic oxygen depletion is the first signal that a system has reached a critical point of eutrophication, which in combination with physical processes that stratify the water column, tips the system into hypoxic conditions (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). Seasonal hypoxia tends to occur periodically during the summer, after algal spring blooms have sunk to the bottom and are being decomposed. It lasts from days to weeks, represents half of the known dead zones, and typically abates in the autumn (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). Boom-and-bust cycles of animal populations are frequent. Persistent hypoxia occurs when hypoxia becomes persistent due to the build-up of organic matter in the sediments over time, particularly in systems prone to persistent stratification. Persistent hypoxia accounts for 8% of reported hypoxia cases. Anoxia occurs when DO levels fall below 0.2 ml per litre. The accumulation of organic matter is exacerbated, and poisonous hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is released due to microbial metabolism.</p> <p><strong>Normoxia:</strong> This regime is characterized by normal levels of dissolved oxygen, typically 5 to 8 ml per liter. Most aquatic organisms are adapted to survive under these conditions. Particularly important are the benthic organisms. Benthos are a community of organisms which live in sedimentary environments at the bottom of water bodies. They constitute an important key functional group (scavengers and detritivores) in the food web responsible for the decay of dead matter. Macrobenthos facilitate bioturbation processes, in other words, they displace and mix particles facilitating chemical exchange between sediments and the water column. This allows the sediments to ''capture'' phosphorous and nitrogen from the water column. By removing these nutrients from the water column, bioturbation therefore reduces algal growth and helps ensure that the water remains oxygenated and suitable for the survival of benthos - creating a reinforcing feedback that maintains normoxia conditions.</p> <p><strong>Hypoxia:</strong> The hypoxic regime is reached when dissolved oxygen level falls below 2 ml per liter (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). Hypoxia is associated with so-called ''dead zones''. These are areas where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most life is not able to persist and only very few specialized microorganisms survive. In the hypoxic state, accumulation of organic matter produced by eutrophic processes favors the growth of microbes who, by decomposing the organic matter, consume the oxygen in the water column.</p> <p><strong>Anoxia:</strong> Anoxia occurs when hypoxia is exacerbated to DO levels under 0.2 ml per liter (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). Under such conditions, benthic animals suffer from mass mortality and decay processes are carried out by microbial metabolism. As A result, hydrogen sulfide is released changing water acidity (pH) and then further favoring bacteria habitat.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Hypoxia is driven by increasing nutrient input, both natural and anthropogenic. Natural sources come from the bottom of the ocean transported by upwellings, water currents that flow vertically driven by the interaction of winds and the temperature gradient between the ocean surface and bottom. Anthropogenic sources are related mainly with the use of fertilizers in agriculture. However, growing urban settlements in coastal areas also increase the water storm runoff and sewage.</p> <p>The leakage of nutrients from agriculture is further exacerbated by rainfall variability and deforestation, since vegetation offers resistance to erosion and trap nutrients and moisture in the soil. Agriculture is driven in turn by increasing demand of food and fibers as well as population growth. Another important factor leading to hypoxic conditions is the stratification of the water column, which reduce the exchange of nutrients between the surface and the bottom. Water stratification is usually driven by anomalous increase in sea surface temperature.&nbsp;</p>","<p>The fast variable in the hypoxia regime shift is DO, and can also include faunal composition. The slow variables are the accumulation of nutrients, mainly phosphorous and nitrogen in the water column. Large areas of the sea are oxygen minimum zones due to natural conditions. Hypoxic-prone areas generally have a semi-enclosed hydrogeomorphology and water-column stratification that restrict water exchange and reoxygenation of the deeper water layers (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). Another natural condition that facilitates hypoxia and eutrophication is coastal upwelling, that lead to nutrient enrichment along continental margins.</p> <p>The normoxia regime is usually&nbsp; maintained by feedbacks that control the nutrients content in the water column and keep oxygen concentrations high. Zooplankton for example plays an important role controlling micro algae numbers, hence limiting their ability to use nutrients available and reduce oxygen through their metabolism. Macrophytes or macro algae also control micro algae by consuming the same resources. Under such conditions nutrients are kept on inorganic forms unavailable for micro algae to use.</p> <p>Under the hypoxia regime the feedbacks above are weakened, allowing micro algae to escape predation and competition controls; and reducing the level of DO in water. As DO decreases, mass mortality of different organism increases the availability of organic matter in the water column, decreasing DO and promoting more micro algae growth. When DO reaches critical levels under 0.5mL per liter, hydrogen sulfide is released further decreasing pH in water and reducing biodiversity. Such extreme regime is called anoxia.&nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Shift from normoxia to hypoxia and anoxia</strong></p> <p>Normoxia is associated with the provision of food for humans and wildife in aquatic systems as well as regulating services such as water purification and pest regulation. This regime shift into hypoxia, often characterised as a dead zone, has been&nbsp;reported in more than 400 systems affecting more than 245,000 square kilometers and including important fisheries such as the Baltic Sea, Kattegat, Black Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and East China Sea (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008).&nbsp;A major impact on ecosystems is a change in the flux of matter and energy through trophic levels. Consequently, fisheries and hence ecosystem services such as food production are affected. For example, Diaz &amp; Rosenberg (2008) report that biomass in the Baltic Sea has been reduced by approximately 264,000 metric tons of carbon due to hypoxic conditions. Assuming that ~40% of benthic energy passes up the food chain, 106,000 metric tons of carbon of food energy for fisheries has been lost(Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). This implies a reduction in yields and consequent impact on employment in fisheries communities. Another example of such effects is the lobster fishery collapse in Norway (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008).</p> <p>Besides its effect on fisheries and employment, hypoxia also affect the health and other cultural services of the people living near by dead zones. Decaying matter after mass mortality events create odors and risk of diseases. Recreation, aesthetic and touristic values are lost.</p> <p><strong>Shift from Hypoxia to Normoxia</strong></p> <p>When hypoxia is not severe, the system is likely to return to normoxia regime. It implies the recovery of fisheries when species hasn't been extinct locally. However, food webs not always fully recover, and usually top predators are lost. With the recovery of the system, fishing, recreational and touristic activities recover too, although not necessary to the same configuration than before the regime shift.&nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Options for enhancing resilience</strong></p> <p>Since one of the main drivers of hypoxia is eutrophication, Diaz &amp; Rosenberg (2008) recommend managing the input of fertilizers on agricultural land. They recognize the necessity of developing new methods to close the nutrient cycle on farms, in order to avoid the drainage of nutrients to water sources. Nutrient reductions can also be achieved relatively cost-efficiently by improving waste-water treatment system in regions where this is applicable (e.g. Baltic Sea).</p> <p><strong>Options for reducing resilience to encourage restoration or transformation</strong></p> <p>Only 4% of the reported cases of hypoxia have shown improvement, principally due to the reduction of organic and nutrient loading, stratification strength, and freshwater runoff (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008).</p> <p>Managers could take advantage of windows of opportunity provided by these variables. For example, in the Baltic Sea the stratification of the water column is determined by input of saltwater from the North Sea (Conley et al. 2009). A policy of nutrient load reduction would therefore be more effective in years when saltwater input is low and it is a particularly rainy year. While nutrient loading is largely periodic and rain dependent, stratification and freshwater runoff rely more on physical processes and climate variability. Finally, it has been suggested that an appropriate goal is the reduction of nutrient loads to the level of the mid-1900s (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008).&nbsp;</p>","(#1) Conley, D; .Björck, S; Bonsdorff, E; Cartensen, J; Destouni, G; Gustafsson, B.G; Hietanene, S; Kortekaas, M; Kuosa, H; Meier, H.E.M; Mueller-Karulis, B; Nordberg, K; Norkko, A; Nuernberg, G; Pitkanen, H; Rabalais, N.N; Rosenberg, R; Savchuk, O.P; Slomp, C.P; Voss, M; Wulff, F; Zillen, L. 2009.

80,2/28/11 0:00,Thermohaline circulation,"Juan Carlos Rocha, Rolands Sadauskis","Reinette (Oonsie) Biggs, Garry Peterson","<p>Thermohaline circulation is the global movement of ocean water from the surface to the deep ocean, which has a major role in regulating global climate. This movement has been halted in the past due to large inflows of freshwater. &nbsp;A regime shift could occur due to the release of large amounts of&nbsp;freshwater into the North Atlantic Ocean. This would reduce the differences in water salinity and density between Southern and Northern Atlantic Ocean that produce the thermohaline circulation, halting the transport of water from the tropical Atlantic to North Atlantic. &nbsp;The high latitudes of the North Atlantic Ocean are perceived as key regions for triggering the collapse of THC. The regime shift is initiated by global warming, currenlty due to human greenhouse gases emissions. &nbsp;Warming is melting arctic ice, increasing the the amount of freshwater entering the ocean water. &nbsp;Several mechanisms may weaken the thermohaline circulation: freshwater-overturning, water temperature-density, and evaporation-salinity. &nbsp;Reducing the risks of this regime shift primarily require halting global greenhouse gas emissions to halt and reverse human caused climate change.</p>",Global climate change,,"Marine & coastal, Rock and Ice","Primary production, Water cycling",Biodiversity,"Freshwater, Food crops, Livestock, Fisheries, Fuel and fiber crops",Climate regulation,,"Food and nutrition, Livelihoods and economic activity, Social conflict",,"Sub-continental/regional, Global","Decades, Centuries",Unknown,"Models, Paleo-observation","Speculative – Regime shift has been proposed, but little evidence as yet","Contested – Multiple proposed mechanisms, reasonable evidence both for and against different mechanisms","Greenland ice sheet collapse, Indian Summer Monsoon","<p>Thermohaline circulation is complex, but can be summarised as a global scale deep overturning of water masses, with sinking motions occurring in the northern Atlantic and around Antarctica and a transport of relatively warm surface waters towards these sinking regions (Steffen et al. 2004). The term thermohaline circulation thus refers to a particular driving mechanism; it is a physical, not an observational concept.</p> <p><strong>Strong Thermohaline circulation </strong></p> <p>THC regime can be characterized by the formation of deep water currents in the high latitudes of both hemispheres; the spreading of deep waters, as deep western boundary currents; upwelling (or upwards movement) of deep waters which is thought to take place mainly in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current region, possibly aided by the wind, and near-surface currents, required to close the flow (Rahmstorf et al. 2006).</p> <p><strong>Collapse of the Thermohaline circulation</strong></p> <p>This regime is characterized by weak formation of the dense and saline high latitude deep waters due to the increased influx of freshwater. The decreased salinity of the deep waters is weakening the density southwards driven water movement. The transport of less dense and saline waters from south towards north is decreased causing additional atmospheric temperature increase in tropical areas.</p>","<p>Increasing greenhouse gas concentration from anthropogenic sources is predicted to cause a rise in global mean temperatures (Cubasch et al. 2001). One of the most common anthropogenic greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide (CO2). It is considered to be the main driver for this regime shift and is typically operating in global scale due to the global input of CO2 in the atmosphere. Increasing CO2 levels in atmosphere increases&nbsp;the mean atmospheric temperature. This results in weakening ice-albedo mechanism for the initial regime as a result of increased atmospheric temperatures and changes in albedo.</p> <p>The increasing freshwater influx from sea-ice loss is accelerated by&nbsp;freshwater-overturning and precipitation-river runoff. This leads to an&nbsp;in&nbsp;increased evaporation, river runoff, and changes to&nbsp;water salinity and density. The&nbsp;burning of fossile fuels such as coal and natural gas also drives this regime shift. This occurs in a regional scale but has global impact&nbsp;and is well established in the literature.</p>","<p>In the regime of strong THC, the most simple explanation of the main variable that maintains the regime would be the high-latitude cooling. In the deep ocean, the predominant driving force of movement of currents is differences in density, caused by salinity and temperature (the more saline the more denser and the colder the water, the more dense). The ocean's density distribution is itself affected by currents and mixing. Thermohaline and wind-driven currents therefore interact in non-linear ways and cannot be separated by oceanographic measurements. Changing the wind stress will alter the THC; altering thermohaline forcing will also change the wind driven currents.</p> <p>The collapse of THC occurs due to increasing CO2 levels in atmosphere that slowly enhance the mean atmospheric temperature. As a result the high latitude cooling is weakened, increasing freshwater influx from the loss of ice, both from the Arctic, Greenland and possibly the north of Canada. This strengthens two main mechanisms for the new regime: freshwater-overturning mechanism and the precipitation-river runoff mechanism. Both increase the fresh water inflow into the ocean. Therefore new mechanism such as increased evaporation, river runoff, changes in water salinity and density are activated possibly reinforcing the new regime. Once the system has shifted, the warm conditions in Northern latitudes maintain a weak formation of the dense and saline high latitude deep waters due to the increased influx of freshwater.</p> <p>Most ocean&ndash;atmosphere models predict a reduction of the THC for a warmer climate in the near future. Recent observational evidence provides some support to the model projections that the North Atlantic THC circulation could weaken or shut down later this century (Steffen et al. 2004). Lenton et al. (2008) report that the IPCC models predict the regime shift to happen after 2100, however, their models do not include freshwater runoff which is expected to accelerate the process. The models that project the collapse of THC under greater perturbations identify that the collapsed state can last for centuries and might be irreversible (Delworth et al. 2008). Nevertheless the latest IPCC report shows that it is very unlikely that the THC will undergo a large abrupt transition during the course of the 21st century (IPCC 2007). Some models show a recovery of the THC after the elimination of the freshwater perturbation whereas others do not. The mechanism for this different dynamical behavior of the THC is not completely understood (Stouffer et al. 2006).</p>","<p>The weakening of THC will impact&nbsp;global water regulation as water circulations in global scale are influenced by the changes in temperature, salinity and density. In response, climate regulation is altered and changes as the transport of heat is distributed in a different pattern. The water mass and heat circulation will no longer transport warm currents in a&nbsp;northly direction. This could increase the occurence of hurricanes, a southward shift of tropical rainfall belts with resulting agricultural impacts, as well as disruptions to marine ecosystems. Provisioning services such as&nbsp;fisheries, livestock and food crops are therefore potentially&nbsp;affected.&nbsp;Schmittner et al. (2007) show that changes in Atlantic circulation can have large effects on marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, even in areas remote from the Atlantic, such as the Indian and North Pacific Oceans. Although loss of THC could affect&nbsp;Western Europe and result in colder climates.&nbsp;</p> <p>Food crisis and emigration are potential threats in the regions that are subjected to this regime shift (Barnett &amp; Adger 2007). In addition, regional changes in sea level are&nbsp;predicted to&nbsp;rise of up to 80 cm in the North Atlantic (Knutti et al. 2002). This could affect the coastlines of the United States, Canada, and Europe causing coastal erosion and affect the security of housing and infrastructure (Delworth et al. 2008). The marine biodiversity of flora and fauna will also be affected. The change in salinity and temperature may facilitate the introduction and spread of invasive&nbsp;species that are able to thrive in the&nbsp;new conditions. This could affect the livelihoods and economic activity of local fishermen as they would have to adapt to new circumstances. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>This regime shift is mainly driven by the increase in&nbsp;greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a global scale. Therefore a decrease in CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases has to be achieved in order to prevent further climate warming leading to large influx of freshwater from the depletion of Arctic ice. In the best-case scenario, it may be possible to avert a regime change in a situation where the underlying driver(s) of change are amenable to fast manipulation through management, and where there are not substantial lags in ecosystem response. In the case of the THC neither of these factors hold: the underlying causes of global warming appear very difficult to address through rapid changes in management, and there are substantial inertias in ecosystem response to changes in the driving factors. Therefore an early warning indicators would be useful in providing advance warning of a substantial coming change in ecosystem conditions, but is unlikely to be useful in averting the regime change.</p>","(#1) Barnett J, Adger WN (2007) Climate change, human security and violent conflict.

Recent observations suggest, however, that major changes in the dynamics of parts of the ice sheet are taking place over large timescales. Widespread thinning at rates generally exceeding those are expected to occur due to recent warmer summers as the atmospheric temperatures are rising. The main identified direct driver behind the loss of ice sheet volume is a warming atmosphere and ocean, which is driven by human greenhouse gas emissions. &nbsp;There are two feedback mechanisms that are maintaining the current regime of the system: an ice-albedo mechanism and meltwater-ice sliding mechanism.

It is grounded on bedrock that mostly rests near or above sea level thus would contribute to the globally averaged sea-level rise of 7.3 m if melted completely (Parizek et al. 2004, Lemke et al. 2007).&nbsp; Anticipated future climate warming has the potential to permanently reduce large areas of GIS or even abate it completely. The evidence suggests nearly total ice-sheet loss may result from warming of more than a few degrees above mean 20th century values, but this threshold is poorly defined (perhaps as little as 2oC or more than 7<sup>o</sup>C) (Alley et al. 2010).</p> <p><strong>Greenland with permanent ice sheet </strong></p> <p>This regime can be described as permanent ice body cover over major parts (~80%) of Greenland only exposing the bedrock in western and southern parts. The Greenland Ice Sheet has been more closely tied to temperature than to anything else. It shrinks with warming and grows with cooling, thus the volume and cover vary throughout the seasons, but in case of cold climate the relationship between the ice growth/decline would be approximately evenly balanced or with a slightly increased ice growth. In winter when the atmospheric temperatures decrease below freezing point and precipitation levels decline, the accumulation of the ice steadily increases (Bamber et al. 2007).</p> <p><strong>Greenland without permanent ice sheet </strong></p> <p>Due to the loss of the ice-sheet volume as a result of the warming, Greenland territory in future could become free from permanent ice sheet cover. This would happen as a consequence of the negative relation to ice growth/ice decline during the winter and summer where the lost ice volume in summer could not be reproduced in the following winter. Rising sea level as a result of warming tends to float marginal regions of ice sheets and force further retreat, so the generally positive relation between sea level and temperature means that typically both reduce the volume of the ice sheet (Alley et al. 2010).</p>",<p>Increasing greenhouse gas concentration from anthropogenic sources is predicted to cause a rise in global mean temperatures (Cubasch et al. 2001). One of the most common anthropogenic greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide (CO2). The influence of this driver is well established as confirmed by&nbsp;many studies. The indirect driver that is increasing anthropogenic CO2 levels in atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. It is occurring regionally but has global impact and is well established in literature.</p>,"<p>The initial regime would typically occur in cold climate conditions where the relationship between the ice growth/decline would be approximately evenly balanced or with a slightly increased ice growth. The two main mechanisms that maintain this regime are ice-albedo mechanism and meltwater-ice sliding mechanism.</p> <p>Increasing CO2 levels in atmosphere - the key driver of the regime shift, initiates the increase of atmospheric temperatures and changes in albedo. As a result - increased absorption of solar energy promotes higher air, ice, water and land temperatures which leads towards degrading sea ice. Also the inland surface temperature increase can cause surface melting in the ablation zone that presently accounts for roughly half of the mass loss from the GIS (Parizek et al. 2004). Thus this driver indirectly is increasing drainage of meltwater feeding into crevasses close to the glacier margin resulting in higher calving rates (Murray et al. 2010). Furthermore, thinning and retreating of the glacier tongue due to these increased rates cause reduced effective pressures beneath the glacier, promoting faster flow that results in decrease of ice volume. &nbsp;</p> <p>The increase in surface air temperatures changes the ice-albedo feedback thermodynamics. This means that the heat exchange within the sea ice, as well as between the top and bottom of the ice is changed. This leads to a decrease in sea ice volume. The resulting increased amount of open land and water surface in summer decreases the albedo, as the dark ocean surface absorbs more solar radiation (Lindsay et al. 2005). &nbsp;The annually integrated absorption of solar radiation is observed to increase when the surface albedo is relatively low (Rigor et al. 2002, Holland et al. 2006). This increasingly accumulated amount of heat on the surface reinforces the initial warming. Due to the loss of the ice-sheet volume as a result of the warming, Greenland territory in future could become free from permanent ice sheet cover. This would happen as a consequence of the negative relation to ice growth/ice decline during the winter and summer where the lost ice volume in summer could not be reproduced in the following winter. The Greenland without permanent ice sheet regime is characterized by other dominant feedback mechanisms. For example ice volume-wave action, the water temperature-density and meltwater-ice sliding velocity mechanisms.</p>","<p>The shift to the regime of Greenland without ice sheet will mainly result in loss of some desirable ecosystem services. The ecosystem service of desirable climate regulation could be lost as the change in movement of currents (change in thermohaline circulation) and air masses would alter the transport of heat. This could lead to increased hurricane activity, a southward shift of tropical rainfall belts with resulting agricultural impacts, and disruptions to marine ecosystems.</p> <p>The loss of certain animal and plant food species as provisioning services is predicted in the future. These changes may have important consequences for food webs and could well be extremely significant for the Greenland economy, which is highly dependent on fisheries (AMAP 2007). Such cultural services like recreation and aesthetical values would also be affected. Each of those services attracts more people to see the Ice sheet thus also bringing in more tourists. Water regulation as regulating ecosystem services could be altered through the large input of freshwater in the water cycle.&nbsp; The vast amount of ''stored'' water entering the water cycle within warmer climate would result in severe winter precipitation.</p> <p>A new ecosystem service is possible as the thawing ice sheet will potentially form glacial freshwater lakes in Greenland. This will generate new recreation opportunities in summer &ndash; using lakes for different purposes from different social groups. Flora could expand deeper into Greenland and new species could be introduced as the climate warms giving the local population the chance to gain additional plant foods.</p>","<p>The potential options for preventing or reversing this potential regime shift mainly relates to the decrease of greenhouse gas input into the atmosphere at a global scale. This has to be achieved in order to prevent further climate warming leading to the loss of Greenland Ice Sheets. Options include reduction of deforestation, use of fossil fuels and charcoal as energy source, and cleaner economies. Geoengineering strategies has also been proposed, large scale experiments to decrease global temperature and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. However, their applicability is debated and the usefulness is contested. As this system boundaries are set mainly around geophysical variables it is necessary to look at the social mechanisms involved to limit the influence on the main direct driver of greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless even if CO2 levels in atmosphere leads to atmospheric temperature increase, it is very hard to achieve from the local to regional management perspective. It does require global coordination and cooperation in order to achieve CO2 reduction targets.</p>","(#1) AMAP. 2009.

78,2/27/11 0:00,Arctic Sea-Ice Loss,Rolands Sadauskis,"Reinette (Oonsie) Biggs, Garry Peterson, Juan Carlos Rocha","<p>A regime shift towards a summer ice-free Arctic is occurring in response to Arctic warming that is demonstrated by reductions in sea ice surface area and ice volume during the summers. A summer ice-loss threshold, if not already passed, is expected to occur well within 21st century. The main driver behind the shift is the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere &ndash; particularly CO2 that is contributing to the increase in average global temperature. Several feedback mechanisms have been proposed that may help maintain the reductions in Arctic ice under the new regime. The primary and best understood is the ice-albedo feedback mechanism where greenhouse gases are causing increased air temperature near the ground/ice surface leading to rapid decrease in ice surface area and volume. Current management strategies primarily relate to the decrease of greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale.</p>",Global climate change,,"Marine & coastal, Rock and Ice",Water cycling,Biodiversity,"Fisheries, Wild animal and plant foods","Climate regulation, Water regulation","Aesthetic values, Knowledge and educational values, Spiritual and religious","Food and nutrition, Livelihoods and economic activity, Security of housing & infrastructure, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values, Cultural identity",,Sub-continental/regional,Decades,"Irreversible (on 100 year time scale), Unknown","Models, Paleo-observation, Contemporary observations",Contested – Reasonable evidence both for and against the existence of RS,Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism,"Thermohaline circulation, Greenland ice sheet collapse","<p>The system is defined by the ice volume and the territory it covers in the Arctic Ocean and the regional/global processes that ensure the existence of ice in this area. The loss of surface area and thinning of Arctic sea ice has not occurred at a linear rate which may be indicative of a systematic change towards an alternate regime.</p> <p><strong>Arctic with summer ice</strong></p> <p>Under this regime, the Arctic Ocean has an abundance of sea ice.&nbsp; It is characterized by very long and cold winters, during which the ice surface area and thickness reach their maximum. The low winter temperatures and short summer help to maximize the sea ice surface area and volume over time.</p> <p><strong>Arctic without summer ice</strong></p> <p>In this regime the surface area and volume of summer sea ice in the Arctic rapidly decreases due to atmospheric warming caused by greenhouse gases. In summer when open water surface area is greater, the albedo is reduced, which causes greater absorption of solar radiation.&nbsp; This raises the temperature of the water and ice, which facilitates greater losses in sea ice surface area and volume. Several models predict that ice free Arctic conditions in summer will be reached within this century (Arzel et al. 2006). Several authors have suggested that the system has already surpassed a tipping point, but convincing evidence is lacking (Lenton et al. 2008).</p>","<p>The main driver of this regime shift is elevated greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere causing an increase in arctic air temperatures. This global driver is well established and could be looked as irreversible in the scale of next hundred years. In regards to the loss of sea ice in the Arctic, the regime shift is generally considered to be irreversible unless the main driver (increased atmospheric temperatures resulting from climate change) is changed in the near future.</p> <p>Anthropogenic activities that elevate atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are generally considered to be the primary driver of climate change (IPCC 2007; Kinnard et. al 2011). Carbon release from anthropogenic sources is projected to continue and increase during the coming decades (IPCC 2007). This is expected to contribute to an increase in average global temperatures and more rapid decrease in sea ice cover and thickness in the Arctic. This driver initially affects the main ice-albedo mechanism thus changing the processes that characterize its initial state. Once the main mechanism has shifted the driver and the altered ice-albedo mechanism initiates change in other parts of the system.</p>","<p>The Arctic with summer ice regime is maintained by permanent low surface air temperatures (SAT) that maintain the thermal balance, thus ensuring balanced heat exchange between the atmosphere, sea ice, and water. The result is maintained sea ice volume, thickness and surface area. This occurs due to ensuring high albedo (a measure of reflectance) level as the dark ocean surface absorbs more solar radiation than the sea ice (Lindsay et al. 2005). This means that the high albedo reflects more radiation avoiding surface temperature increase. Avoiding increased absorption of solar energy promotes lower air, ice, water and land temperatures which lead towards maintaining sea ice. In the end, the low temperatures further promote ice maintaining arctic conditions.</p> <p>There is near universal agreement that the extent of Arctic sea ice will decline through the 21st century in response to increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (Zhang 2006). The resulting increase in surface air temperatures (SAT) change the thermal balance which means that the heat exchange between the atmosphere, sea ice, and water is changed. The result is a decrease in sea ice volume, thickness and surface area. The increased area of open water in summer decreases the albedo as the dark ocean surface absorbs more solar radiation than the sea ice (Lindsay et al. 2005). &nbsp;Increased absorption of solar energy promotes higher air, ice, water and land temperatures which lead towards degrading sea ice volume (Rigor et al. 2002; Holland et al. 2006). In the end, the increasing temperatures and accumulated heat further promote warming arctic conditions</p> <p>Changes in the summer extent of Arctic sea ice are not solely forced by SATs, but could also be affected by fluctuations of atmospheric pressure at sea level that controls the strength and direction of windsin the region. More probably these changes could be driven by a combination of these (and/or other) forcing (Kinnard et al. 2011).</p>","<p>Local knowledge and spiritual values might be lost as the local communities have to adapt to the new circumstances and thus their lifestyle. In addition to concerns about the security of infrastructure and impacts on human well being, ice free Arctic summers have important impacts on ecosystems. One such impact is that loss of ice cover could affect the Arctic's freshwater system and surface energy budget, and manifest in middle latitudes as altered patterns in atmospheric circulation and precipitation (Serreze et al. 2007). This presents the way how water and atmospheric circulations could be altered as ecosystem services.</p> <p>Summer sea ice concentration is important for navigation, and may have implications for the transport of sediments and pollutants across the Arctic. Most of the sea ice formed in the Arctic Ocean is exported through the Fram Strait into the Greenland Sea and to the North Atlantic where the ice may affect the global thermohaline circulation (Rigor et al. 2002). Sea ice also blocks the solar flux to the water and hence is a major control factor phytoplankton to seals, walrus, and polar bears while limiting access to the surface for seals and whales (Lindsay et al. 2005).</p> <p>The rapidly melting sea ice in the Arctic Ocean has increased political and economic interest in the region's resource extraction and in the potential for more accessible shipping routes. By opening the Northwest passage, shipping route through the northern Canadian waters, could result in a positive economic impact. Although this also could potentially result in ecological disasters as the possibility of oil spills and other disasters associated with development would increase.</p>","<p>The options for preventing or reversing the loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic primarily relate to the decrease of greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale to reduce climatic warming. As atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations increase, it is essential to understand local and regional actions that may influence the feedback mechanisms influencing the shift to an ice free summer Arctic. Technology transfer could be a good initiative from developed countries as they can provide more advanced technological solutions to developing countries to help accelerate the learning curve on GHG emissions. A Global response particularly from developed nations that are using the majority of the world&rsquo;s resources on a per capita basis should be in place to deal with such complex system.</p>","(#1) Arzel O, Fichefet T, Goosse H. 2006.

Evaporation of water following floods accumulates salts at the soil surface, and dry-spells prevent salts from being flushed back down into the water table. Older soils that contain great concentrations of salts are more prone to salinization. Dryland salinization occurs worldwide, but the greatest region is in Australia, in dryland areas with very old, salt rich soils.</p> <p><strong>Nonsaline Topsoil </strong></p> <p>The nonsaline topsoil regime is characterized by landscapes with normal topsoil salt levels, deep water tables, and healthy plant communities. Rainfall leaches high salt concentrations from topsoil to below the root zone. In cultivated areas, crop water-uptake is unhindered and crop growth is normal. Land produces high yields, supporting livelihoods and providing food and nutrition. Freshwater is not saline, supporting biodiversity and providing clean water (Anderies et al. 2006).</p> <p><strong>Saline Topsoil</strong></p> <p>The saline topsoil regime is characterized by elevated water tables, significantly higher than normal soil salt levels and reduced plant growth across the landscape. High concentrations of salt in the topsoil reduce the uptake of water by plants and impede nutrient absorption. Some salts may also be toxic to plants when present in high concentrations, inhibiting plant growth. Under extreme salinization, a white crust of salt accumulates at the soil surface, and only salt tolerant plants are able to grow. Persistent high water tables change the hydrology of local aquifers considerably. Surface water becomes brackish, harmful to wildlife and unsuitable for irrigation. In cultivated regions, crop yields are restricted, threatening livelihoods and reducing food and nutrition. High levels of salt in freshwater can make water non-drinkable and harm wildlife and corrode water infrastructure, roads, and bridges (Neilsen et al. 2003; Pannell 2002).</p>","<p>The main direct driver that leads to the shift from normal to saline topsoil is elevation of dissolved salts within the water table to the soil surface. Typically, this rise in groundwater is due to a decrease in evapotranspiration due to the removal of deep-rooted perennial plants, such as trees. The water table can also rise due to intensive use of irrigation. Agriculture is the major indirect driver of both deforestation and irrigation (Anderies 2005).</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Nonsaline to Saline Soil </strong></p> <p>Arid landscapes with normal topsoil salt levels have diverse communities of perennial plants that have evolved deep roots to survive periods of drought. These plants continually use and transpire water as it becomes available, so that little water infiltrates to the ground water. Where cultivation occurs, drought tolerant crops are grown and irrigation is not part of agricultural practice. The presence of deep-rooted native vegetation maintains the normal regime, as they have evolved to efficiently use the limited precipitation in arid and semi-arid areas. Deep rooted plants evaporate water from the soil, prevents water tables from rising and salinization of the root soil profile. The lack of salt in the soil profile in turn enables the persistence of deep-rooted vegetation. Crop plants that are grown are adapted to arid climates and are able to efficiently use available water. A social feedback that maintains this regime is the reproduction of agricultural and land management practices that maintain deep rooted plants and do not use irrigation (Pannell 2002; Anderies et al. 2006).</p> <p>If deep-rooted plants are removed and replaced with shallow rooted annual crops, the regulation of the water table by deep-rooted plants is removed. However, the consequences of this removal may not become visible for decades as the water table rises slowly. The changes in water flow through a dryland ecosystem due to land use change are less visible, but can be many times larger than those due to irrigation (Gordon et al. 2003).&nbsp;The hydrology of the system can be further disrupted by the application of irrigation water, especially if this water is from outside the watershed. Crop irrigation exacerbates the risk of salinization not only because it contributes to the rise of groundwater, but also because the irrigation water can contain salts that leach from the soil and then are concentrated at the soil surface when the water evaporates. Once saline groundwater enters the root zone, plants quickly move the water and the salts it contains to the soil surface.</p> <p>Salts continue to be deposited to the soil surface as long as the water table remains in the root zone. Salinity impedes the ability of plants to use water, which reduces growth rate. At higher levels of salinity plants are damaged, older leaves die and photosynthetic leaf area is reduced, until plants die (Munns 2002). If salts are not flushed below the root zone, land can becomes unproductive for the long term.&nbsp;A social feedback that can maintain the saline regime is an agricultural dependence on irrigation. Producing crops for large-scale markets often requires for continued intensive production to be viable. Investments in irrigation equipment can become a sunk cost, as their expense necessitates their continued use. As salt accumulate in the soil profile, producers become further dependent on irrigation to flush salts below the root zone. This agricultural system maintains the knowledge, infrastructure, and resources to conduct irrigated agriculture, but does not support other approaches to agriculture (Allison and Hobbs 2004).</p>","<p>No ecosystem services are gained in this regime shift. Where crops are grown, the salinization regime shift negatively impacts ecosystem services such as food production, livestock feed, protection from soil erosion, human nutrition, livelihoods and economic activity. Freshwater becomes contaminated with salt, which can reduce the availability of drinking water, reduce fish and other aquatic populations, and damage infrastructure. In saline soil biodiversity is reduced as only salt-tolerant species can live in saline soil. Availability of wild plant and animal products are also reduced. Farmers lose the security of their livelihoods due to lost crop yield and degraded soil and water.</p> <p>Hunters and outdoor recreation seekers lose due to a loss of wildlife. The general public loses availability of high quality, low cost good, as well as clean water. Salinized soil can benefit people who mitigate and adapt to salinization, such as desalinization technology providers and salt tolerant crop breeders.</p>","<p>Management to prevent soil salinization involves maintaining a mix of deep-rooted perennial vegetation and crops in order to prevent the rise of the water table, and limiting the amount of irrigation water that is applied to the system. However, the management of dryland salinity is complicated by the difficulty of understand groundwater dynamics and the long delays (decades to centuries) between action and response in some dryland groundwater systems.&nbsp;Long-term methods to keep the groundwater level below the root-zone include planting of deep-rooted vegetation and salt tolerant plants. However, while planting the halt the rise of a water table it will likely take decades to lower it. Apart from the direct effects of lowering the water table and reducing the salt concentration in the topsoil, if the planting of deep-rooted vegetation can be linked to economically beneficial activities this strategy can contribute to increasing the diversity of the agricultural system. This may improve soil health and make the ecosystem less vulnerable to disturbances (Anderies 2005).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Once the root zone has become saline, there are several short-term management options for removing the accumulated salts or preventing further salt accumulation. These include mechanically scraping surface salt (which leads to the problem of salt disposal), or flushing the topsoil using water (which has poor efficacy and might exacerbate the problem in situations with high water tables). A more efficient option is to create a surface water drainage system using field ditches to avoid the deposition of salt, combined with subsurface water pumping to decrease the water table level (Abrol et al. 1988). Another approach, used in Australia, is to pump groundwater to lower the water table. The expenses arising from the implementation and maintenance of such drainage or pumping systems are, however, substantial (Anderies 2005).Social systems also offer great potential for managing soil salinity. Water pricing systems, long-term tenancy of the land, use of appropriate technology and farmer's education can contribute significantly towards the goal of maintaining productive land. However, the substantial social resistance of the established irrigation regime can block many attempts at reform (Allison &amp; Hobbs 2004, Anderies et al. 2006)</p>","(#1) Abrol IP, Yadav ISP & Massoud FI “Salt-Affected Soils and their Management”, Rome, 1988, FAO Soils Bulletin 39, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Coral reefs are old calcareous tridimensional structures created by corals - coral polyps colonies in symbiosis with microscopic algae. This regime implies high biodiversity and three dimensional habitat complexity that offer shelter to other species.</p> <p>Coral reefs occupy less than 0.5% of ocean floor but sustain up to 25% of marine biodiversity, and produce at least 10% of fish consumed by humans (Moberg and Folke 1999). Due to their three dimensional structure coral reefs host up to 60 000 species of plants and animals (Moberg and Folke 1999); and this rich diversity makes coral reefs a target for tourism. In over 100 countries, coral reefs are major natural and economic resources (Goreau and Hayes 1994). For example, coral reefs are one of the major attractions in the Carribean.&nbsp; In that region tourism is a major source of foreign currency. In some Carribean countries tourism accounts for up to half of nation's gross domestic product (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007).</p> <p>Coral reefs can also reduce coastal erosion by reducing the impact of ocean currents and waves.&nbsp; Consquently, intact coral reefs protect coastal infrastructure and valuable sandy beaches.&nbsp; Furthermore, increases in erosion can result in the degradation or loss of other coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and sea-grasses areas, which provide valuable ecosystem services such as fish nurseries (Moberg and Folke 1999, Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007).</p> <p><strong>Algae dominated reefs</strong></p> <p>Algae dominated benthos appear when algae overgrow corals. Submarine algal emerge and reduce coral growth, eventually leading to the loss of the habitat complexity of coral reefs (Bellwood et al. 2004).&nbsp; Algae dominated reefs have lower biodiversity, fish production, and provide less protection from coastal erosion. There is also less primary production on algae dominated reefs (Moberg and Folke 1999).</p> <p><strong>Coralimorpharians, soft corals and sponges</strong>.</p> <p>Although less documented, other regimes can dominate former coral reefs when dramatically disturbed (Bruno et al. 2009, Norstr&ouml;m et al. 2009). Norstr&ouml;m et al. (2009) reports that system dominated by coralimorpharians, soft corals, and sponges are alternative regimes where coral patches can fall when strongly disturbed. Corallimorpharians, soft corals and sponges are thought to reduce habitat complexity and hence biodiversity. Thus, one may expect to see fisheries production and tourism services reduced. However, because such systems are not well studied it is unclear to what extent the ecosystem services provided by coral reefs are reduced.</p> <p><strong>Urchin barrens</strong></p> <p>Urchins are herbivores that live on coral reefs.&nbsp; In the absence of predatory fish, urchins can become the dominant grazer on reefs and produce urchin barrens.&nbsp; Urchin barrens inhibit coral growth, because urchins erode calcium carbonate from living and dead corals eroding reef structure.&nbsp; When urchins are present at densities high enough that their erosion exceeds coral growth, urban barrens can form (Norstr&ouml;m et al. 2009).</p> <p>Urchin barren are the regime with most severe habitat complexity loss, which reduces habitat for other species.&nbsp; There is low production of fish, and the urchin populations are vulnerable to disease.&nbsp; However, urchin can be a valuable species when harvested, therefore urchin barrens can support an urchin harvest.&nbsp;</p> <!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings> <o:PixelsPerInch>72</o:PixelsPerInch> <o:TargetScreenSize>544x376</o:TargetScreenSize> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--><!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:View>Normal</w:View> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom> <w:PunctuationKerning /> <w:ValidateAgainstSchemas /> <w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</w:SaveIfXMLInvalid> <w:IgnoreMixedContent>false</w:IgnoreMixedContent> <w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText> <w:Compatibility> <w:BreakWrappedTables /> <w:SnapToGridInCell /> <w:WrapTextWithPunct /> <w:UseAsianBreakRules /> <w:DontGrowAutofit /> </w:Compatibility> <w:DoNotOptimizeForBrowser /> </w:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:LatentStyles DefLockedState=''false'' LatentStyleCount=''156''> </w:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--><!-- [if !mso]>  <object  classid=''clsid:38481807-CA0E-42D2-BF39-B33AF135CC4D'' id=ieooui> </object> <![endif]--><!-- [if gte mso 10]> <![endif]-->","<p>Coral regime shifts are driven by multiple drivers, including overfishing, pollution, disease, global warming and ocean acidification (Bellwood et al. 2004; Bruno et al. 2007; Mumby et al. 2007). The hard coral regime is more desirable than the other five regimes for most people, because of the inherent biological, social and economical importance of coral reefs.</p> <p>All regime shifts from hard coral dominated to any of the alternative regimes are influenced by the same set of drivers. However, differences in the resulting regime are produced by contextual features or the ordering of events. For example, coral reef systems in the Indian Ocean are more likely to shift towards coralimorpharians, soft corals or sponges since algal grazing herbivores are more persistent than they are in the Caribbean, where macro-algae dominance is more common. The role of different drivers is relatively consistent across cases, but variation in their impact, timing and interaction likely produce different types of regime shifts in different regions.&nbsp;</p> <!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings> <o:PixelsPerInch>72</o:PixelsPerInch> <o:TargetScreenSize>544x376</o:TargetScreenSize> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--><!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:View>Normal</w:View> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom> <w:PunctuationKerning /> <w:ValidateAgainstSchemas /> <w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</w:SaveIfXMLInvalid> <w:IgnoreMixedContent>false</w:IgnoreMixedContent> <w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText> <w:Compatibility> <w:BreakWrappedTables /> <w:SnapToGridInCell /> <w:WrapTextWithPunct /> <w:UseAsianBreakRules /> <w:DontGrowAutofit /> </w:Compatibility> <w:DoNotOptimizeForBrowser /> </w:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:LatentStyles DefLockedState=''false'' LatentStyleCount=''156''> </w:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--><!-- [if gte mso 10]> <![endif]-->","<p>Most coral reefs occur in tropical and sub tropical areas between 30&ordm;N and 30&ordm;S of the equator. Optimal temperature conditions for corals vary between 26-27&ordm;C and corals are very sensitive to changes in temperature. Few species are adapted to warmer waters, cold or deep waters. Coral reefs are maintained by a symbiotic relationship between coral polyps and zooxanthellae, where polyps offer shelter and nutrients to the algae which in turn provide energy to the coral as a byproduct of their photosynthesis.</p> <p>When coral cover is reduced there is increased colonization by algae, which in turn inhibits coral recruitment &ndash; i.e., a positive feedback exists (Mumby et al. 2007, Norstr&ouml;m et al. 2009). Herbivores (mainly fish) control the growth of algae through grazing, scraping, and bioeroding (Nystr&ouml;m and Folke 2001). Regime shifts to coralimorpharians, soft corals, and sponges have been attributed to a combination of bad water quality, bleaching events and diseases outbreaks that weaken corals and inhibit their reestablishment (Mumby et al. 2007, Norstr&ouml;m et al. 2009). These regime shifts are more likely to occur in settings where herbivores control macroalgae populations. On the other hand, regime shifts toward urchin barrens imply a strong component of biodiversity loss of both algae grazers and predators, leaving urchins as dominant herbivores. Shifts to urchin dominance have been reported to follow pulse disturbances as bleaching events and low-tides (Norstr&ouml;m et al. 2009).</p> <p>The presence of coral&nbsp;near a coral reef increases its resilience to regime shifts, and vice versa.&nbsp; For all types of regime shifts described, there is a common pattern in regard to spatial resilience. Coral rely on meta-population dynamics for successful reproduction. In other words, spatial connectivity is needed to allow larvae interchange. It increase genetic variability and well connected reefs are likely to better cope with shock disturbances. However, when connectivity is broken, corals relay on self-seeding and are more vulnerable to depletion of local stocks, bleaching events and other disturbances (Elmhirst et al. 2009, Hughes et al. 2010)&nbsp;</p>","<p>A regime shift from a coral reef to another regime results in a decline in multiple ecosystem services including coastal erosion regulation, fisheries, tourism, water cleansing, and calcium fixation (Moberg and Folke 1999).&nbsp; Coral reefs occupy less than 0.5% of ocean floor but sustain up to 25% of its biodiversity and produce at least 10% of fish consumed by humans (Moberg and Folke 1999).&nbsp; Alternative regimes do not support biodiversity or fish to the same extent. &nbsp; Constanza et al.(1997) estimated the value of coral reefs services at up to US $6 075 per hectare per year based on their contribution to disturbance regulation, waste treatment, biological control, refuge habitat, food production, raw materials, recreation and cultural values.&nbsp; Many of these services are lost or substantially reduced when regime shifts away from coral reefs occur.</p> <p>Coral reef regime shifts can result in the collapse of coral fisheries that can produce unemployment for fishermen, and reduce the value of the fishery, as well as reduce food production. Recreational services (primarily based around diving and snorkelling) are diminished when regime shifts occur, causing losses estimated at up to AUS $682 million in the Great Barrier Reef and US $8.9 billion for the Caribbean, in addition to 350 000 jobs related in the Caribbean (Moberg and Folke 1999). Coral reefs support cultural and spiritual values such as religious rituals, cultural traditions and institutional frameworks for cooperative fishing, especially in small scale fishing communities (Moberg and Folke 1999).&nbsp;</p>","<p>Options for enhancing resilience</p> <p>''The persistence of hard coral dominated reefscapes beyond 2050 will be heavily reliant on 2 things, the ability of corals to increase their upper thermal bleaching limits by ~0.1&deg;C per decade, and management that produce local conditions that constrain excessive algal biomass proliferation during inter-disturbance intervals'' (Wooldridge et al. 2005).</p> <p>Coral reef regime shifts are driven by local, regional and global drivers.</p> <p>Given that temperature and acidification are global drivers that are difficult for local mangers to influence, Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2007) emphasize the management of the local level drivers. Due to the multi-causal nature of coral regime shifts, scholars emphasize the necessity of managing coral reefs using an ecosystem approach. Such an approach requires taking into account the interaction between land and sea, as well as the scale and origin of the stressors when making decisions at different scales of governance (Moberg and Folke 1999). Management programs which successfully address the improvement of water quality, reduction of sediments, nutrients, toxins, pathogens and fishing pressure will increase the likelihood of corals to recover to shocks like bleaching events (Wooldridge et al. 2005; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007; Houk et al. 2010b).</p> <p>Herbivore populations are a key driver that can be actively managed because reduced grazing increases the vulnerability to regime shifts (Mumby et al. 2007). For example, herbivorous fish like parrotfish can be protected. It has been suggested that markets should be transformed to incorporate a body of incentives to prevent the depletion of species in critical functional groups (Bellwood et al. 2004). The abundance of sea urchins should also be carefully managed because urchin dominance can produce negative effects on coral recruitment (Norstr&ouml;m et al. 2009).</p> <p>The spatial resilience of coral reefs is a regional driver that is possible to manage by managing connectivity, metapopulation dynamics, and to take into consideration the spatial distribution of coral reefs (Moberg and Folke 1999, Nystr&ouml;m and Folke 2001). This is because large-scale regional shifts are typically preceded by smaller-scale localized shifts. Therefore, monitoring the occurrence and spatial distribution of smaller-scale regime shifts may help to anticipate, and potentially avert, large-scale catastrophic shifts (Norstr&ouml;m et al. 2009).</p> <p>To manage spatial resilience, Bellwood et al. (2004) recommend increasing the rate of establishment and size of no-take areas, including 'cool-spots' of biodiversity. The reason is that areas with low species richness may be more vulnerable, as they may have lost functional groups, or may have low functional redundancy. Hence, minor changes in such ecosystems may trigger regime shifts locally, and erode spatial resilience regionally. International agreements are badly needed to keep oceans condition below the 480ppm and +2&ordm;C thresholds for coral reefs (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007).</p> <p>Reducing pressure from global scale drivers, requires coordinated global action, but would substantially increase the resilience of coral reefs.&nbsp;</p> <!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings> <o:PixelsPerInch>72</o:PixelsPerInch> <o:TargetScreenSize>544x376</o:TargetScreenSize> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--><!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:View>Normal</w:View> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom> <w:PunctuationKerning /> <w:ValidateAgainstSchemas /> <w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</w:SaveIfXMLInvalid> <w:IgnoreMixedContent>false</w:IgnoreMixedContent> <w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText> <w:Compatibility> <w:BreakWrappedTables /> <w:SnapToGridInCell /> <w:WrapTextWithPunct /> <w:UseAsianBreakRules /> <w:DontGrowAutofit /> </w:Compatibility> <w:DoNotOptimizeForBrowser /> </w:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:LatentStyles DefLockedState=''false'' LatentStyleCount=''156''> </w:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--><!-- [if gte mso 10]> <![endif]-->","(#1) Bellwood, D., T.

It accounts for 80% of mean precipitation of India but it has decreased 4-5% in the last five decades. A regime shift from Indian summer monsoon with mean and regular precipitation within the season towards a weakened monsoon precipitation may be occurring in response to changes in vegetation driven by agricultural change. Changes in vegetation cover are leading to a decrease in the temperature difference between land and ocean that is essential for the creation of monsoon precipitation. A weaker monsoon reduces rainfalls with strong consequences for agricultural productivity in one of the densely populated areas of the world. The local and regional&nbsp;vegetation cover therefore needs to be managed sustainably to prevent a weakening of the Indian Summer Monsoon circulation system. This requires redusing greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing deforestation and cropland area planning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>","Vegetation conversion and habitat fragmentation, Harvest and resource consumption, Soil erosion & land degradation","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Large-scale commercial crop cultivation, Extensive livestock production (rangelands), Timber production","Moist savannas & woodlands, Drylands & deserts, Agro-ecosystems",Water cycling,Biodiversity,"Freshwater, Food crops, Livestock, Wild animal and plant products, Timber, Fuel and fiber crops, Hydropower","Air quality regulation, Climate regulation, Water regulation",Aesthetic values,"Food and nutrition, Health (eg toxins, disease), Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values, Social conflict",,Sub-continental/regional,"Years, Decades",Unknown,"Models, Paleo-observation, Contemporary observations","Speculative – Regime shift has been proposed, but little evidence as yet","Contested – Multiple proposed mechanisms, reasonable evidence both for and against different mechanisms","Forest to Savannas, Dryland degradation","<p>The Indian Monsoon system is solar heating driven and starts in the southernmost point of the Indian Peninsula where it splits into two parts. One branch moves along western part of India northwards and the other flows over the Bay of Bengal heading towards North-East India and Bengal, picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The winds then arrive at the Eastern Himalayas along with&nbsp;heavy rainfall. After the arrival at the Eastern Himalayas, the winds turn West, covering northern and eastern India, Bangladesh, parts of Pakistan, and southern Nepal pouring rain all along its way. There are several changes in monsoon intensity that have been documented on centennial to millennial time scales, when the East Asian Monsoon rapidly strengthened while the Indian Summer Monsoon rapidly weakened (Bing et al. 2006). Although several studies have indicated that the East Asian summer monsoon has also become weaker after the end of the 1970s (Wang et. al 2001). Therefore, the end of 1970s may be viewed as an abrupt and significant change point in the inter-decadal variability of the East Asian summer monsoon (Ding et al. 2008). The change of both monsoon systems weakening at the same time might therefore point to a shift in the interconnected monsoon system.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Indian summer monsoon with mean and regular precipitation within the season</strong></p> <p>In this regime precipitation reaches its annual mean and ensures that agriculture receives enough water to sustain the production of crops and other goods. The rapid change in increase of CO<sup>2</sup> concentrations in the atmosphere has supported the existing regime increasing the sea surface temperature thus increasing the precipitation. The Indian Summer monsoon circulation is characterized by monsoon rains arriving at&nbsp;the start of June as warm air converges and ascends in the low pressure over the continent, leading to clouds and heavy rainfall. Monsoon rains advance northward as summer progresses, enhanced by forced ascent as the flow reaches the Himalayan foothills. In winter, this thermally direct circulation reverses as the land surface cools relative to the oceans. Rains continue till the end of September when the season ends. (Rickenbach et al. 2009).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong> Indian summer monsoon with weak and irregular precipitation within the season</strong></p> <p>This regime is characterized by weak precipitation causing droughts with the rain arriving much later than expected in June. The increasing emissions of fossil fuel SO<sup>2</sup> and black carbon result in large atmospheric concentrations of black carbon and other aerosols generating atmospheric Brown clouds. This induces strong negative trends in surface solar radiation, surface evaporation, and summer monsoon rainfall (Ramanathan 2005). As the monsoon season starts, precipitation can be irregular - raining in June and then having weak or no precipitation in July and returning in August.</p>","<p>The main direct driver of changing monsoon rains is deforestation associated with the indirect driver of increased food production. As a consequence of the vegetation loss due to deforestation the surface albedo is increased. Therefore the amount of reflected solar radiation increases due to high albedo, thus decreasing the temperature difference between ocean and land. All this leads to change in the main monsoon circulation mechanism that is responsible for precipitation in the region.</p> <p>The increasing concentration of CO<sup>2</sup> in the atmosphere is a driver, although its not sure as to whether it maintains the current regime or pushes the system towards a regime with weaker precipitation. Researchers are still arguing which case is most likely and it depends on the source to present the influence of this driver. IPCC report (2007) predicts that carbon release from anthropogenic sources will continue increasing during the coming decades. There are studies indicating that emissions of greenhouse gases that alter the heat budget of the system and therefore the land-sea temperature contrast, could increase the monsoon intensity and/or variability (Knopf et al 2008; Kripalani et al. 2007). Nevertheless Palmer et al. (1992) pointed out that enhanced convection (the transfer of heat by the actual movement of the warmed matter) associated with the warm SST anomalies suppresses the monsoon rainfall.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>For the monsoon precipitation to occur the main atmospheric processes have to be present (latent heat, land to ocean pressure gradient, advection etc.). The release of latent heat from precipitation over land ensures the increase in the temperature difference between land and ocean. This enhances the land to ocean pressure gradient that determine in which direction and at what rate the pressure changes around the Indian peninsula. The increased pressure gradient leads to stronger winds and pushes more moist air northward from the ocean onto the continent. The stronger flows on shore increases landward advection of moisture eventually forming rain clouds which leads to increased precipitation and associated release of latent heat.</p> <p>However the increasing deforestation in regional scale reduces vegetation cover therefore decreasing&nbsp;rainfall and&nbsp;increasing surface albedo. The monsoon circulation is thereby weakened as the amount of reflected solar radiation increases due to high albedo, decreasing the temperature difference between ocean and land.</p> <p>As a result weaker pressure gradient leads to weaker winds pushing less moist air onto the continent. As the flows onshore are weaker landward advection of moisture decreases, which leads to decreased precipitation. This reinforces the lack of vegetation cover as the soil moisture decreases resulting in droughts and increased biomass burning occurs which decreases vegetation cover even further.</p>","<p>Due to irregular precipitation one of the most essential and recognized provisioning services that could be lost is freshwater as the groundwater levels are becoming deeper thus drying up the soil. Food crops and livestock are two other provisioning services that are directly affected by this regime shift and linked with the freshwater service. Losing these services would mean poor harvests and food shortages from lack of cattle among the rural population, which constitutes two thirds of India's total population (Knopf et al. 2008). Timber production would also be affected, as barren and dried soils can no longer&nbsp;support the growth of trees. Also the fire frequency would increase damaging timber productivity even more.&nbsp;Regulating services would be lost, such as climate regulation as a weak summer monsoon can change climate variability (Gordon et al. 2008). Air quality regulation as a service is endangered because of increased aerosol/dust and Brown cloud concentrations caused from biomass burning and industrial pollution. Regulation of water and soil erosion would be lost as monsoon rains ensure that soils are moist and inhabited with flora and fauna enough not to lose the fertile topsoil due to wind or other type of erosions. Water regulation would also be in danger, as lack of precipitation would alter the water cycle changing the typical water distribution in it.&nbsp;Biodiversity would rapidly decrease in the case of weak precipitation in the long term.</p> <p>Human wellbeing would also be affected, as monsoon rains are critical to the functioning of hydroelectric power plants.&nbsp;The lack of precipitation would therefore disrupt energy supply which may&nbsp;cause delays in productions or increase product&nbsp;costs. The loss of food crops may results in food crisis, leading to rapid inflation on food prices. In turn this can lead to large number of people suffering from hunger, as any adverse effect on farming will affect the purchasing power of the people as well. The hunger and rise of poverty could result in large numbers of people emigrating from the region (Barnet &amp; Adger 2007). Lack of freshwater also could aggravate the sanitation and health issues that already haven't been completely solved. Crime levels could potentially rise as the depression among society would increase and the necessity for food would drive the people to support their families in any circumstances (Barnet &amp; Adger 2007).</p>","<p>Options for preventing a weakening of the Indian summer monsoon circulation system primary relates to the sustainable management of the local and regional vegetation cover. The area of complete deforestation should be decreased and cropland area planning has to be in place. That has to be done in order to avoid rapid changes in surface albedo in large areas that can change the existing feedback mechanisms. Sustainable water management planning has to be practised to avoid significant water due to irrigation. New irrigation practises has to be considered such as the installation of&nbsp;drip irrigation and low pressure pivots to get more yield with less use of water. It has also been suggested that a better weather forecasting system for India would help people to better adapt strategies in times of droughts and floods induced by the monsoon variability (Nature News Blog, Aug-2011).&nbsp;Greenhouse gas emissions&nbsp;also need&nbsp;to be managed to reduce air pollution and&nbsp;the amount of black carbon in the atmosphere tht&nbsp;increases the formation of brown clouds that negatively influence the monsoon rainfall.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Technology transfer could be a good initiative from developed countries as they can provide more advanced technological solutions and funding to developing countries to help accelerate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and irrigation management. Investing in sustainable irrigation tools and supporting the industrial production industry for example with filters that decrease the amount of pollutants entering the atmosphere, techniques that are energy efficient.&nbsp;Overall the shift in the Indian summer monsoon circulation is considered to be irreversible if the changes in vegetation cover due to food production continue to increase.</p>","(#1) Bing H,Qinghua L,& Yetang H. 2006.

72,2/15/11 0:00,Freshwater Eutrophication,"Juan Rocha, Reinette (Oonsie) Biggs, Garry Peterson",Steve Carpenter,"<p>Freshwater eutrophication refers to the excessive growth of aquatic plants or algal blooms, due to high levels of nutrients in freshwater ecosystems such as lakes, reservoirs and rivers. The main driver of freshwater eutrophication is nutrient pollution in the form of phosphorous from agricultural fertilizers, sewage effluent and urban storm water runoff. Beyond a certain threshold of phosphorous accumulation, a recycling mechanism is activated which can keep the system locked in a eutrophic state even when nutrient inputs are substantially reduced. Freshwater eutrophication can substantially impact ecosystem services affecting fisheries, recreation, aesthetics, and health.</p>","Vegetation conversion and habitat fragmentation, External inputs (eg fertilizers), Species introduction or removal","Urban, Large-scale commercial crop cultivation, Intensive livestock production (eg feedlots), Fisheries, Land use impacts are primarily off-site (e.g. dead zones)",Freshwater lakes & rivers,"Primary production, Nutrient cycling",Biodiversity,"Freshwater, Fisheries, Wild animal and plant foods",Water purification,"Recreation, Aesthetic values","Food and nutrition, Health (eg toxins, disease), Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values, Social conflict",,Local/landscape,"Years, Decades","Irreversible (on 100 year time scale), Hysteretic, Readily reversible","Models, Paleo-observation, Contemporary observations, Experiments",Well established – Wide agreement in the literature that the RS exists,Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism,"Hypoxia, Fisheries collapse, Bivalves Collapse, Coral Transitions","<p>The shift from oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions occurs when a body of water &ndash; a lake, river or reservoir &ndash; accumulates excessive nutrients. This process can happen naturally over several centuries as a lake ages and accumulates sediments and nutrients from the surrounding landscape. Alternatively, human activities, especially the use of fertilizers, causes freshwater eutrophication to occur much more rapidly and extensively than in the past.</p> <p><strong>Low Nutrient Clear water/Oligotrophic</strong></p> <p>In the clear water regime, phosphorous inputs, phytoplankton biomass (algae), and phosphorous recycling from lake or river sediments are typically low, and the water is clear. Such systems are called oligotrophic. Oligotrophic lakes are associated with the provision of services such as freshwater, fisheries and food for wild animals. It is also related with pest and disease regulation as well as water purification. Clear water lakes are also used for recreation and their aesthetic values.</p> <p><strong>High Nutrient Turbid Water/Eutrophic</strong></p> <p>In the eutrophic regime, phosphorous inputs, phytoplankton biomass, and phosphorous recycling from sediments are usually high, and the water is turbid or murky. Such systems are called eutrophic or nutrient rich (Carpenter 2003, Smith and Schindler 2009).</p> <p>Eutrophic lakes have significant impacts on fisheries, both commercial and recreational. Murky water and unpleasant odors cause loss of aesthetic value. Toxin produced by algae may affect livestock, mussels, oyster and even humans when water is used for drinking (Lawton and Codd 1991).</p>","<p>The main causes of lake eutrophication is excess nutrients inputs, especially phosphorous. Over enrichment of phosphorous often leads to algae blooms which&nbsp;changes both the trophic structure of the lake and the chemical environment. Consequences include depletion of oxygen in the water and increase in water turbidity, creating harsh conditions for fish and plants to survive.</p> <p>Nutrient inputs are driven by the use of fertilizers in agriculture. Therefore, indirect drivers such as food demand and population growth exacerbate the problem. Rainfall variability also plays a synergistic role with land use change, allowing further erosion of soils and leaking of the nutrients not used by crops. Urban growth often increases the flux of nutrients by changing the landscape surface by one less permeable, increasing leakage and sewage production.&nbsp; Untreated sewage is often a major cause of eutrophication near cities or towns.</p>","<p>Clear water or oligotrophic freshwater occur when nutrient inputs are low and nutrient concentrations are maintained at low levels by flora and fauna of the lake. The vegetation, for example, consumes phosphorous from the water column, and its roots immobilize phosphorous in the lake sediments by stabilizing the sediments. Phosphorous is also trapped in sediment or in inorganic forms, biologically unavailable for small algae.</p> <p>Increasing nutrients input can overwhelm the capacity of plants to control phosphorous levels both by consumption and immobilization in sediment.&nbsp; The ability of a freshwater ecosystem to regulate nutrients depends upon a number of ecological and geographic factors.&nbsp; Ecological factors include the structure of the food web (the amount of predation on algae), the presence of vegetation (which shades or stabilizes the sediment), and the presence of sediment disturbing biota (which mobilizes nutrients).&nbsp; While geographic factors include degree to which the lake is mixed by wind, temperature, and depth.&nbsp; Increased mixing and temperature can decrease the resilience of the clear water regime by encouraging algae growth.</p> <p>A lake can be maintained in a eutrophic or high nutrient regime, by changes in the food web that favour algae, continuation of sediment disturbance, or the mobilization of stored phosphorus due to chemical recycling due to low oxygen conditions in the sediment.</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Oligotrophic to Eutrophic lake</strong></p> <p>Eutrophication induces large changes in ecological communities and hence the configuration of food webs. Primary producers (algae) experience massive population increases, while fish and shellfish may suffer large population declines due to lack of oxygen. Consequently less energy is captured by higher trophic levels, and more by the lower trophic levels. Rooted aquatic plants tend to be lost due to shading by algae. The loss of macrophytes has cascading effects on zooplankton and other organisms that depend on these plants for habitat and food (Carpenter&nbsp; 2003).&nbsp; These food web changes are accompanied by changes in the phosphorous and carbon cycles of the affected ecosystems: larger quantities of phosphorous and carbon are cycled through the ecosystem at higher rates. In addition, large swings in the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water may take place (Carpenter 2003).</p> <p>Changes in the ecological communities resulting from eutrophication can make a system more vulnerable to invasion by new species or to disease outbreaks. Nutrient-rich waters are a good environment for the development of pathogens like cholera (Smith and Schindler 2009). Some algal blooms produce toxic compounds, such as neurotoxins, that can move up the food chain resulting in illness or death when consumed by animals or humans (Lawton and Codd 1991).</p> <p>Eutrophication has several direct consequences for human well-being (Carpenter et al. 1998, Postel and Carpenter 1998):</p> <ul> <li>Loss of fish species from eutrophic ecosystems impact commercial, subsistence, and recreational fishing;</li> <li>Recreational use of water bodies for swimming, boating and angling are reduced,</li> <li>The value of lakeside properties and recreational areas are reduced due to unpleasant odours and murky water,</li> <li>The costs of water treatment for domestic, industrial and agricultural uses increases,</li> <li>Toxins produced by certain algal blooms may cause death of livestock (and humans) if eutrophic water is used for drinking,</li> <li>Biotoxins produced by algae may be taken up by shellfish such as mussels and oysters, and can lead to the poisoning of humans when consumed (Lawton and Codd 1991).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Shift from eutrophic to oligotrophic lake</strong></p> <p>The degree of reversibility from eutrophic to oligotrophic conditions varies greatly. In some lakes oligotrophic conditions have been restored rapidly after reduction of phosphorous inputs, while in other cases lakes have remained eutrophic despite prolonged reductions in phosphorous inputs and even dredging of the lake sediments (Carpenter et al. 1999, Carpenter 2003).</p> <p>Ecosystem services may recover once the system shift back to oligotrophic regime. However, some species may never come back to initial abundance and the food web may change drastically. Consequently, the impact of eutrophication on fisheries depends upon the species being fished. Other services related with aesthetic and recreational values including tourism can fully recover.</p>","<p><strong>Options for enhancing resilience</strong></p> <p>Freshwater ecosystems react in different ways to increases and reductions in nutrient loading, depending on their shape, water current patterns, and biological characteristics. Different strategies for managing eutrophication will therefore be required in different settings (Smith 2003).</p> <p>The main management option, both for prevention and restoration, is to reduce phosphorous inputs. Developing technology and economic incentives to close the nutrient cycle at the local (farm) level is crucial (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). Reforestation of watersheds can help buffer the impact of rainstorms on soil erosion and phosphorous runoff. Importantly, phosphorous sources tend to be concentrated spatially in the landscape. Reducing runoff from a small number of high source areas can have a major impact on water quality, and should be a priority.</p> <p><strong>Options for reducing resilience to encourage restoration or transformation</strong></p> <p>Active intervention may be needed to reverse eutrophic conditions. For instance, lake floor sediments can be dredged, or phosphorus can be immobilized by adding aluminium sulphate (Carpenter 2003). Bottom-feeding fish such as carp, which physically stir up lake-floor sediments when feeding, can also be removed.</p> <p>Another option for managing eutrophication is through ''biomanipulation'' of food webs (Scheffer 1997). This involves increasing the population of predatory fish such as bass, pike and walleye through stocking or reduced angling quotas. Increased populations of these predators leads to a decrease in the level of zooplanktivores. This in turn allows an increase in the population of planktivores that graze on the algae, helping to reduce the algal density. Results from biomanipulation studies have given rise to the idea that, to reduce eutrophication, lakes should be managed to contain an even, rather than odd, number of trophic levels (Smith and Schindler 2009).</p>","(#1) Carpenter S, Ludwig D & Brock W. 1999.
